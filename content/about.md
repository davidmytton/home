Welcome! I’m David Mytton, CEO of [Arcjet](https://arcjet.com), a software
startup that helps developers protect their apps. I'm also co-founder of
[Console](https://console.dev/), a devtools newsletter which helps developers
find the best tools.

I'm an angel investor in early-stage developer-first startups and I'm also
working towards an [Engineering Science
PhD](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-engineering-science)
in sustainable computing at the University of Oxford. My research has been
[featured](/press/) in The Times, WSJ, Financial Times, Fast Company, Computer
Weekly, and Sky News.

From 2009-2018, I was Co-founder & CEO at [Server
Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), a SaaS infrastructure monitoring
startup. I built the original product, including the open source monitoring
agent and custom time series database used by 700+ customers to manage mission
critical IT environments. I grew the company in the UK and US through
bootstrapped revenue and [subsequent VC
funding](https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/10/server-density/) through to exit in
2018 to a US edge computing business, StackPath. As part of the acquisition, I
joined [StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/) to lead Product Engineering
across a suite of edge computing and security products, leaving in Dec 2019.

Whilst completing an [Environmental Technology
MSc](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/environmental-policy/msc/) at [Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) 2019-2020, I developed an interest in
sustainable computing and continued that research on the sustainability team
at [Uptime Institute](https://uptimeinstitute.com/), a global data center
advisory organization, between Dec 2020 and Nov 2021.

I also founded the [HumanOps](https://www.humanops.com) community in London, San
Francisco, and New York with Facebook, Financial Times, Spotify, Yelp and
PagerDuty aimed at
[discussing](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/DevOps-done-right-Why-work-life-balance-matters-to-digital-transformation-success)
how to deal with the human side of system operations: on-call, incident
response, stress, fatigue, post-mortems and human process design.

From 2018 to 2023 I was an Expert in Residence
at [Seedcamp](https://www.seedcamp.com/) (unpaid), a London-based seed fund with
450+ portfolio companies ([who also funded Server
Density](https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/sep/10/startups-digital-media),
and are now also an investor in Arcjet).

## Sustainable computing research

I am researching [sustainable

Oxford. You may want to check out:

   consumption](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-021-00101-w) (npj Clean Water),
   and [data center energy
