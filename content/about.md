---

Welcome! I’m David Mytton, Co-founder & CEO of [Console](https://console.dev/),
which launched early-2021 to provide the best tools and jobs for developers. I
angel invest in early-stage devtools, cloud, and API startups through [Console
Zero](https://console.dev/zero/).

I am working (part-time, from Oct 2022) towards an [Engineering Science
PhD](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-engineering-science) in [sustainable
computing](/sustainable-computing/) at the [University of
Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). My work has been [featured](/press/) in the media, such as
The Times, WSJ, Financial Times, Fast Company, Computer Weekly, and Sky News.

Whilst completing an [Environmental Technology
MSc](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/environmental-policy/msc/) at [Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) 2019-2020, I developed an interest in
sustainable computing and continued that research on the sustainability team
at [Uptime Institute](https://uptimeinstitute.com/), a global data center
advisory organization, between Dec 2020 and Nov 2021.

From 2009-2018, I was Co-founder & CEO at [Server
Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), a SaaS infrastructure monitoring
startup. I built the original product, including the open source monitoring
agent and custom time series database used by 700+ customers to manage mission
critical IT environments. I grew the company in the UK and US through
bootstrapped revenue and [subsequent VC
funding](https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/10/server-density/) through to exit in
2018 to a US edge computing business, StackPath. As part of the acquisition, I
joined [StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/) to lead Product Engineering
across a suite of edge computing and security products, leaving in Dec 2019.

I also founded the [HumanOps](https://www.humanops.com) community in London, San
Francisco, and New York with Facebook, Financial Times, Spotify, Yelp and
PagerDuty aimed at
[discussing](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/DevOps-done-right-Why-work-life-balance-matters-to-digital-transformation-success)
how to deal with the human side of system operations: on-call, incident
response, stress, fatigue, post-mortems and human process design.

I am an Expert in Residence at [Seedcamp](https://www.seedcamp.com/) (unpaid), a
London-based seed fund with 430+ portfolio companies ([who also funded Server
Density](https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/sep/10/startups-digital-media)).

## Sustainable computing research

I am researching [sustainable
computing](https://davidmytton.blog/sustainable-computing/) at the University of
Oxford. You may want to check out:

   consumption](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-021-00101-w) (npj Clean Water),
   and [data center energy

   Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/) project – I implemented
