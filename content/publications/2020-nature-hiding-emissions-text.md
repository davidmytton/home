To the Editor — Data centres account for 200 TWh yr–1, or around 1% of total
global electricity demand[^1]. While their energy usage has been stable in
recent years as efficiencies increase, it may grow to between 15–30% of
electricity consumption in some countries by 2030 (ref. [^2]).

The majority of this growth is attributed to cloud computing, particularly by
the largest ‘hyperscale’ vendors such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The
market size for cloud computing has grown from $6 billion in 2008 to $288
billion in 2019 (ref. [^3]), with the majority of future growth in information
technology (IT) workloads across all types of data centres expected to be in the
cloud[^4].

If outsourced to the cloud, IT emissions previously accounted for under the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol[^5] Scope 1 — emissions that are directly linked to the
activities of an organization from sources that it owns and control — and Scope
2 — emissions from the generation of purchased energy — move to Scope 3,
referring to all other emissions. When an organization purchases its own
equipment and signs contracts for electricity from a co-location facility, all
their IT emissions fall under Scope 1 or Scope 2 (ref. [^6]). If the IT workload
is moved to the cloud, the organization is no longer directly generating
emissions under Scope 1 and is not purchasing energy under Scope 2. Therefore,
all those emissions move to Scope 3.

Currently, Scope 3 emissions tend to be reported only voluntarily, and the
emissions are aggregated into the global emissions reporting by the large cloud
vendors[^7] [^8] [^9], which can result in individual corporation’s emissions
being hidden when they are moved to the cloud. This is an issue, as where
national reporting rules require disclosure of emissions statistics, only Scope
1 and Scope 2 emissions are compulsory (for example, see ref. [^10]).

Deploying in the cloud is claimed to be significantly greener than the old data
centre approach, as the technology sector is the largest purchaser of
renewables[^2] and the major cloud providers compete to be the greenest. Google
is carbon neutral and has purchased renewable electricity to match 100% of its
electricity usage since 2017 (ref. [^8]); Microsoft, also carbon neutral, has
pledged to match renewables by 2025 (ref. [^11]), as has Amazon[^12].

The problem lies in the lack of transparency. None of the data required to
calculate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of an organization is available
once they move to the cloud. Cloud vendors’ aggregated global reports do not
provide the data needed to understand the environmental footprint. If an
organization is implementing reporting under International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) 14064-1 then it will be unable to attribute its ‘other
indirect emissions’, the ISO standard category equivalent of Scope 3 (ref.
[^13]). Further, if an organization wishes to mitigate its emissions, such as
through offsets, then the only option is to rely on the cloud vendor to do it
for them.

A 2019 report shows how challenging it is to make estimates without data and
highlights the lack of transparency at a local level[^14]. The report
methodology attempted to estimate data centre sizes from Freedom of Information
requests combined with data from lease and energy contracts. Even this only
allows for estimates of energy usage in a particular region — more granular data
from inside the data centre is needed to understand and accurately account for
emissions from cloud workloads.

The good news is that this may be changing. At the beginning of 2020, Microsoft
announced the availability of their Sustainability Calculator[^15]. This is a
tool for their Azure cloud customers, which provides a GHG Protocol compliant
report of the emissions from purchased cloud resources. However, it is currently
limited to ‘Enterprise’ customers and is an add-on to a commercial reporting
product, PowerBI, which means it is not generally available to every Azure
customer. Despite this, this tool may be the catalyst needed to encourage others
to do the same. Even if the underlying data to make the calculations is not
available, the final emissions calculation is the most important figure.

As more workloads move to the cloud, more companies wish to demonstrate their
environmental credentials, and as mandatory reporting is adopted by more
countries, it is important that GHG emissions figures continue to be calculated.
Transparent and consistent financial accounting rules allow for companies to be
analysed and compared — the same should be expected for environmental reporting.
