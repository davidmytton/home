I regularly angel invest into early-stage startups where developers are the
primary user.

I'm interested in anything that we'd feature in the
[Console](https://console.dev) devtools newsletter. With an audience of >26k
experienced developers, the most specific thing I bring is helping reach early
users. A feature in the Console newsletter can easily result in several thousand
new signups. I also have experience building early engineering teams and
advising on developer experience and developer go-to-market.

## What I invest in

Anything where developers are the primary user - cloud, devtools, APIs, devops,
security, SaaS, open source. I apply the [Console selection
criteria](https://console.dev/selection-criteria/) plus [my own investing
criteria](https://blog.console.dev/devtools-startups-standing-out-to-investors/)
and typically invest $25k. I invest globally, although most of my investments
are in the US. Israel and Europe are also well represented!
