---

I'm interested in angel investing in any early-stage startups where developers
are the primary user.

With the [Console](https://console.dev) newsletter audience of >27k experienced
developers, the most specific thing I bring is helping reach early users. I also
have experience building early engineering teams and what is needed to build a
good developer experience.

## What I invest in

Anything where developers are the primary user - cloud, devtools, APIs, devops,
security, SaaS, open source. I apply the [Console selection
criteria](https://console.dev/selection-criteria/) to [my own investing
criteria](/devtools-startups-standing-out-to-investors/) and typically invest
$25k. I invest globally, although most of my investments are in the US.
