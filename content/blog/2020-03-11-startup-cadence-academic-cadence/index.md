I have now been out of day-to-day startup operations for almost two years; since
my company was acquired in May 2018. In September 2019 I started [a full time
MSc at Imperial College
London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/environmental-policy/msc/). The comparison
with 9 years in startups is interesting.

The main difference is the cadence of work. Although there is a substantial
course workload, everything in academia is so slow and based on the arbitrary
criteria of “academic judgement”.

Contrast this to startups where [the only thing that matters is achieving
product-market
fit](https://davidmytton.blog/the-one-job-of-the-early-stage-startup-cto/), then
scaling in a manner appropriate to your business model ([investor
funded](https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling) or [profit/lifestyle
focused](https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider/)).

This affects the cadence.

Academia is about spending time researching, getting things right and eventually
publishing your results ([which almost nobody
reads](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/half-academic-studies-are-never-read-more-three-people-180950222/)).
Think of how long this takes. Months to write a paper. Months to go through a
peer review process. An unknown amount of time before anyone reads or uses your
work (if ever). And that doesn’t include the time spent reading, practicing and
learning before you can even think about writing a paper.

Startups are the opposite extreme. A couple of founders can build a prototype
product in a few weeks, gain traction and start generating revenue within
months. Iteration happens rapidly and feedback comes in constantly. I am
currently writing an academic paper on data center energy and in the time it has
taken me to write, read and wait for feedback from my supervisor, one of the
companies I have invested in has closed a pre-seed round, made several initial
hires, had early customer talks, built an initial prototype and is now in the
process of closing a multi-£m seed round.

Of course, academia is supposed to be like this. Sure, things could be a bit
faster, but the steady pace is a deliberate part of the scientific process. It
means that things are properly tested, evidence based and trustworthy (we hope,
assuming we can figure out the [replication
crisis](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)).

The tech industry is also suffering from excessive speed. We have failed to
understand and deal with problematic content, [leaving it to a small number of
oligopolies to police things for us without transparency or
accountability](https://davidmytton.blog/cloudflare-free-speech-and-the-rule-of-law/).
The investor/VC approach has also been heavily criticised for inflicting [huge
damage on founder and employee
health](https://davidmytton.blog/startup-founder-hierarchy-of-needs/).

So what can we learn from this?

The first area of relevance comes when hiring from one sector to another. People
used to the academic pace – particularly those spending years on PhDs – often
struggle in startups.

Although I have really enjoyed studying again, as I try and get a paper
published I am finding the academic pace frustratingly slow.

Context appropriate cadence matters. Startups are hard and most fail, so you
have to test quickly. Academic research takes time because of the depth and
complexity of many areas, combined with the rigour of peer review. Where these
areas converge is a problem. Technology moves so rapidly that the academic
approach is likely to break and it is frustrating to have to continually review
a draft paper as things change, whilst waiting for the slower aspects of
academic review. We are seeing similar things with the current virus outbreak,
with [preliminary papers being published with limited
review](https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/sharing-research-data-and-findings-relevant-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak).

If you have any interest in crossing sectors, understanding their differences
and trying to mitigate them is important. During this time, I have tried to stay
connected to the startup community by investing in early-stage startups and
getting involved with specific tasks for the founders. This has reminded me of
the excitement of building a startup. [My role at
Seedcamp](http://seedcamp.com/team/david-mytton/) allows me to see many new
companies trying new things. This has allowed me to avoid getting out of touch –
I can focus on studying a really interesting area for a year – then come out the
other side inspired to get back involved with startups again.

This is not about one being better than the other, but being aware of the
differences and how to take advantage of them. Startups are an extreme form of
business not suited to most people. Academia is the same in its opposites. This
is probably why most people go and work elsewhere! I’m glad to be able to
experience both.
