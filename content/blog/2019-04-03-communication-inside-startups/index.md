Once you have more than 1 person in a company, I think communication is the
biggest challenge. I don’t think it matters whether you’re working 100% remotely
or have everyone in the same office, the challenge of communication remains
similarly difficult.

The challenge and how to solve it changes depending on the size of the company
but there are common questions that everyone should have a concise and precise
answer for at all times:

- What is the overall mission of the company? Why are we doing what we’re
  doing? How is the company tracking against that mission? What is going well
  and what isn’t?
- What are the company values? How should we evaluate the ways of achieving
  our mission?
- How do we work and collaborate together?
- What is expected of me today, this week, this month and this year? How does
  that link to the overall mission? How am I tracking against those goals?
  What is going well and what isn’t?
- What is the rest of the company doing?

Practicing complete transparency is the best way to smooth the flow of
information to different people across the company, whether they are employees,
executives, board members or investors.

There are very few classes of information which may not benefit from full
sharing – disciplinary and HR matters, complaints and perhaps individual
compensation packages (but having a consistent, open set of salary bands makes
up for that).

So what do these different areas involve? What are the key things that need to
be communicated?

## What is the overall mission of the company?

Later in the life of a company it should be obvious what the product is, but it
may be harder to explain the why: Why are we building this? Why have we built
that feature? What is the big problem we are trying to solve over the next 10-20
years?

This is crucial to understand because every other aspect of the company flows
from this single mission. Everyone needs to know the mission because otherwise
they cannot understand why the work they are doing is important to achieving
that mission.

The best mission statements are short but specific. Easy to remember and
obvious, but hard to achieve and involve playing the long game.

One of my favourites is Tesla:

> …the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors (and the reason I am funding the
> company) is to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy
> towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not
> exclusive, sustainable solution.
>
> [Secret Tesla Motors Master
> Plan](https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me)

And SpaceX:

> The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology, with the
> ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.
>
> [About SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/about)

These are both very clear about the problem and what the company is trying to
do.

But the mission doesn’t need to be as big picture or ambitious as what Elon Musk
is trying to achieve – it’s just as important to have a clear mission if your
goal is to build a small but successfully sustainable company.

Without a clear, written statement, you cannot align the rest of the company
goals, understand how to prioritise what to do next and will certainly find it
difficult to hire and retain your team.

Even simple mission statements require constant communication. The whole company
need to know not just what the company is working towards but how things are
tracking against that goal. With real numbers and commentary on both positive
and negative progress, the mission will be reinforced.

This means having regular reporting of KPIs to the whole company. You are
probably doing this for investors [and your
board](https://davidmytton.blog/structuring-startup-board-meetings/) already so
this format can be reused for the rest of the company.

Information about company performance either gets out through actively sharing
the real numbers or it is distributed through rumour and gossip. There is no
option where information doesn’t travel, so why would you not want to be in full
control of the narrative and detail?

Doing this builds trust in good times so that you can call on the team when you
enter more challenging times. With everyone aware of the same numbers, everyone
has the same context for making decisions, understanding why decisions were made
and making their contribution as valuable as possible.

## What are the company values?

The company mission is always very high level – it describes “what” and “why”
but doesn’t really discuss “how”.

I used to think that the idea of “company values” was a cliché but that is only
true if they are vague and written in generic management speak. If the company
values don’t prescribe specific behaviour then they aren’t particularly useful.

Netflix has perhaps the most famous description of its culture and values, from
[the culture deck CEO Reed Hastings
published](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) almost 10 years
ago.

More recently, these have been written out as a set of high level principles
which they then break down into specific values.

> Like all great companies, we strive to hire the best and we value integrity,
> excellence, respect, inclusivity, and collaboration. What is special about
> Netflix, though, is how much we:
>
> 1. encourage independent decision-making by employees
> 2. share information openly, broadly, and deliberately
> 3. are extraordinarily candid with each other
> 4. keep only our highly effective people
> 5. avoid rules
>
> Our core philosophy is people over process.
>
> [Netflix Culture](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture)

Whether you use the term “values” or not isn’t the point – it is about having a
written description of how you approach things. They describe how the team
behaves, help you recruit new people who match those values and evaluate the
existing team as to whether they are meeting those expectations.

Note the keyword: written.

The task of writing down the values is a good thought exercise in itself but
then they can also be referenced and modified over time. If they’re not written
down then there is too much of an opportunity for digression, forgetting key
values or people just misremembering.

Another example is GitLab, who are [unusually
transparent](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) in everything they do. Indeed,
this is one of their core values.

> GitLab’s six values
> are Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, Diversity, Iteration,
> and Transparency, and together they spell the CREDIT we give each other by
> assuming good intent.
>
> [GitLab Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/)

The important thing is making them actionable, for example under “Results” they
explain:

> **Measure results not hours**  
> We care about what you achieve; the code you shipped, the user you made happy,
> and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon off shouldn’t
> feel like they did something wrong. You don’t have to defend how you spend
> your day. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid
> rules. Do not incite competition by proclaiming how many hours you worked
> yesterday. If you are working too long hours talk to your manager to discuss
> solutions.
>
> [GitLab Values: Results](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results)

Making the values actionable and measurable is what transforms them from high
level clichés into a true set of operating principles for the company.

## How do we work and collaborate together?

Do you message someone directly on Slack? Do you send an email with an
announcement? Is it expected that you will engage in discussion in the comments
on a Google Doc? Does documentation go in Confluence?

These are questions everyone has when they first join a company and so should be
part of the standard operating system of the business. Everyone should be using
the same tools and processes and there should be exactly one way of doing
things. You know this is going wrong when you see such behaviour as:

- Missing crucial information because it was sent as a Slack message late at
  night in your timezone and there were hundreds of other messages afterwards
  so you didn’t see it.
- Bugs getting reported through anecdote, mixing multiple issues that then get
  fixed in an ad-hoc way without tracking the resolution, often resulting in
  duplicated work as other people try to reproduce an issue that has already
  been fixed.
- People don’t check their email often because they don’t get many messages
  and instead work in real time chat all day, meaning they miss meeting
  notifications or an important customer message.
- Documentation is written in Confluence by one team but another team is using
  Sharepoint to work on a Word doc.
- People are mentioned in document comments but the answer is provided through
  another channel and the original comment is left open and unresolved.
- Information and documentation exists in one place but it isn’t easily
  searchable so people end up asking individuals for work that has already
  been done.
- Decisions get made without you being aware and you only find out through
  luck or because someone happens to mention it in passing.

Discipline is easier when the company is small and just getting started – that’s
the best opportunity to set the rules and processes, and tell new hires how to
do things. When there is a lack of direction, teams will end up using their own
tools and systems because it’s better for them but to the detriment of the
overall efficiency of the company.

Sometimes changes to working processes are needed, especially when a new tool is
discovered that makes a difference to the working practices of the organisation.
But adopting something new should be a deliberate evaluation and decision
process.

If teams end up spinning off their own processes and tools, that is an
indication of poor direction and/or failure of an existing approach.
Dissatisfaction with the status quo should trigger a review and debate rather
than a secret team/deployment of a new vendor product.

I personally dislike Slack (and any real-time chat) for anything other than
general, social chat or deliberate collaboration on an ongoing project e.g.
triaging a customer issue with a group of people in real time, doing incident
response, or backchannel chat between participants during a sales meeting. These
are all instances where a small number of people come together for a specific
task and for a specific period of time, after which they disband. Real time chat
is an awful tool for anything else because it implies everyone must be available
and responsive immediately, at all times. Information is too easily lost.

My personal preference is defaulting to asynchronous communication via email,
where I can set up my own workflow, control notifications and respond in my own
time and in appropriate detail. Chat has its uses but I consider it (and
notifications in general) highly damaging for any kind of focused knowledge work
like writing or coding. This is not a unique view:

With 10 years of remote working experience with the majority of that spent with
chat as a core communication tool, my preferred working style now is to assume
that everything is asynchronous by default, with the ability to do urgent
interrupts rarely.

Real time chat like Slack has its place, but should be limited by both
configuration and convention. For example:

> 1. Slack is to be used for informal communication only. Only 90 days of
>    activity will be retained.
>
> 2. If you use Slack, please avoid private messages. [Private messages
>    discourage
>    collaboration](http://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/).
>    You might actually be contacting the wrong person and they cannot easily
>    redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the
>    moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help.
>    Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach.
>    This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people
>    if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.
>
> …  
> 6. Slack messages should be considered asynchronous communication and you
> should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the
> other person is doing.
>

> Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#slack)

Limiting retention forces everyone into [the mode of the chat being
ephemeral](https://davidmytton.blog/email-is-not-a-good-database/) and
minimising private messaging helps encourage transparency, avoiding interrupting
specific people. And if it really does need to be synchronous, a video/audio
call (which can then be recorded, transcribed and [stored in a searchable
format](https://davidmytton.blog/the-organisational-commit-log/)) is still
probably better.

## What is expected of me?

At this point we are down to the day to day activities of individual team
members. If the above items are done well, each person will understand what the
company is doing, what guides their approach and the key tools and processes
they should be using. That leaves the question: what should I actually be doing?

The worst kind of work is where you are simply following orders. Sometimes
specific tasks will be assigned e.g. preparing a spreadsheet of KPIs or fixing a
reported bug. However, most work should be [driven by
outcomes](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/01/outcome-driven-innovation-product-managers/),
leaving the individual to decide how they achieve it guided by the mission,
values and tools.

There are plenty of systems that can be used to decide what should be worked on,
with the most popular (at least in startups and Silicon Valley)
being [OKRs](https://firstround.com/review/How-to-Make-OKRs-Actually-Work-at-Your-Startup/).
I’m actually not a big fan of them and couldn’t get them to work well at my
company, but I do subscribe to some of the key principles of OKRs, specifically:

> **“The ability to track results on a quantitative basis.”** Key results are
> not general or subjective actions you plan to take. They should always include
> numbers to make it clear how much has been achieved. For example, if Mary’s
> objective is to improve her sales prospecting skills, one key result might be
> to spend two hours a week shadowing Jennifer, the team member who demonstrates
> the most prospecting success.
>
> [How to Make OKRs Actually Work at Your
> Startup](https://firstround.com/review/How-to-Make-OKRs-Actually-Work-at-Your-Startup/)

Whatever system you use, the key is that people know what they should be doing
and how it links to the overall company mission. OKRs are one way to achieve
this but need to be implemented with all the other things discussed above
– [they won’t just magically solve a communication
problem](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/29/okrs-arent-going-to-fix-your-communication/) if
there is no understanding of the company mission, values and processes. The team
should not only know what they’re supposed to be working on and why, but be able
to explain it to others:

> Following the HR rep’s suggestion, I start to ask questions. Actually, a
> single two-part question: *What are you doing, and Why?*
>
> For the What, I rely on a variant of my old I Can’t Be Stupid gambit: If I
> don’t understand what you’re saying, either you don’t actually know what
> you’re talking about, or you’re withholding something. As for the Why, please
> don’t say you’re just following orders — I know you have a mind of your own;
> and don’t hide behind “marketing demanded it” as if you respect marketing.
> Tell me how your work serves the common purpose. Does it improve performance,
> reduce cost, increase reliability, forge a killer feature? If you can’t tell
> me, perhaps you should go back to your desk, gather your thoughts, and come up
> with some answers that make me feel smarter and safer.

## What is the rest of the company doing?

With all of the above implemented, everyone should have a good idea of where the
company is going and what is being worked on, at least at a high level. Knowing
what is actually happening on a day to day basis is easier in small companies
but as the team grows and the product becomes more complex (possibly with
multiple products), it becomes harder to know who everyone is and what they’re
individually doing.

This essentially comes down to two things:

1. Transparency: are the systems, tools and processes open enough so that
   anyone can look at any document or ticket if they wish (subject to certain
   restrictions around confidentiality – GitLab again have [good guidelines on
   what is not
   default-public](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-guidelines/#not-public))?
2. Real communication: is there regular discussion from the executive team
   explaining what is going on throughout the business – whether that is
   highlighting big (and small) wins, releases, problems or just regular
   reporting on activities.

There is also a question of relevance. In a company of 10 people it makes sense
for everyone to know everything, and to be specifically told about all
activities. If you have 10,000 people then the level of detail needs to change.
Information should still be available if individuals wish to look it up, they
just might not be told the complete detail on a regular basis.

Most companies do a poor job at this, especially the bigger ones. Coordination
across teams within a single department is often frustrating enough that trying
to get all teams fully aware is a big challenge. That doesn’t mean it can’t be
done.

One good example where this is a regular problem is with the selection of
technology and building internal systems. Large companies, organisations and
especially the public sector suffer from duplication of systems which can only
really be solved through proper value chain mapping.

Wardley Maps are a great way to understand the landscape, something which most
companies are awful at.

This doesn’t just stop at knowing who is building what but actually goes into
the entire company strategy. That’s an entirely separate topic, though. [Read
the book on Wardley Maps for the real
detail](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec).

## So how do you achieve this?

Establishing a regular communication and reporting cadence is a standard part of
running a public company – financials and progress get announced in an expected
format on an expected timeline. If public companies can do this on a quarterly
basis, there’s no reason why smaller companies can’t do it too, and likely much
more regularly.

At my company, I used to send out monthly updates to all my investors via email.
This tied in with my monthly board meetings and included details about all KPIs,
an analysis of the results and what the plans were for the next month. I sent
out the exact same report to all team members internally as well.

I also ran weekly whole company meetings where everyone had a minute to talk
about something interesting they had done during the week, and as the CEO I
commented on positive developments, good work I’d seen and provided an update on
challenges, problems or anything else that was relevant.

If I was implementing this again I would think about the following:

- Reporting KPIs on a weekly basis via email and highlighting the top 2
  metrics in the weekly meeting (likely revenue numbers). A good real-world
  example of implementing a system of reporting is described in [The Founder’s
  Guide to Discipline: Lessons from Front’s Mathilde
  Collin](https://firstround.com/review/the-founders-guide-to-discipline-lessons-from-fronts-mathilde-collin/),
  particularly around regular emails and meetings to highlight progress.
- Building an internal KPIs dashboard with real time data that everyone could
  access.
- Recording and transcribing all meetings so they are [easily searchable and
  reference-able in
  future](https://davidmytton.blog/the-organisational-commit-log/), then
  emailing this out to the entire company (for the whole company meetings, and
  having a good index for all other meetings).
- Having all individual goals and measures for the “What is expected of me”
  section public on some kind of internal profile directory. This helps to
  answer the question of “What is the rest of the company doing?” and means
  people can directly link to their goals when helping others prioritise work.
  If everyone knows what you’re working on and why, they can figure out how
  their request can help achieve the goals of both parties.
- Regularly discuss all aspects of the company mission, values and processes
  to get input on what is working and what isn’t. Just because you decide on
  an approach when the company is founded does not mean that you have to stick
  to it.
- Being more deliberate about having a single source of truth for all
  documentation, values and the overall company handbook from the beginning of
  the founding of the company.

Communication is not static. The best way to do something today might change
tomorrow. You have to repeat things and ask obvious questions. It can be
difficult to know how well communication is actually working but you can
certainly tell when it’s poor. Things are often getting done despite the
communication overhead. People are guessing what they should be doing and there
is a low level buzz about how well the company is truly doing. Nobody has any
guiding principles helping them decide what they should be doing and there is
often a lot of sudden urgency around arbitrary deadlines [like working in a
feature
factory](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2).

This is a big challenge all companies face, and it is one that is never solved.
Whether you have an extreme level of secrecy and control like Apple or at the
other side of the spectrum like GitLab, I think monitoring communication and
actively working on improving it should be a top priority for the entire
executive team.
