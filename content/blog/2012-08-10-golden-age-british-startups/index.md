The UK’s golden age is often referred to as being some time in the past when
things were better, cheaper and easier. But as far as starting a business is
concerned, I believe that time is now.

When I started my first company in 2004, aged 16, I remember spending weeks
researching the requirements, visiting local government business advisers
(having to take the bus because there was none where I lived) and reading
photocopied factsheets. Business Link, the government-funded support service,
was most useful in printed booklet form and only one of the big banks would even
consider opening an account for me. Today, the basic foundations of any company
– incorporation and a bank account – can be completed online in a day for £14.

Support networks now exist to help you every step of the way that simply were
not around just a few years ago. From regular, informal meet-ups of like-minded
individuals like London’s DrinkTank or the community around Birmingham Science
Park, to incubator programmes like ignite100 in Newcastle and Seedcamp, which
travels around cities across Europe, there is no shortage of experienced
advisers willing to mentor and invest in seed-stage ideas. Having secured an
investment from Seedcamp for my current start-up back in 2009, I can attest to
the value, aside from the cash itself, of being able to easily access a wide
range of interesting people not just in the UK but around the world.

Since 2008, the British government has also put a lot of effort into
restructuring tax incentives, with major improvements in almost every one of the
annual Budget statements. Through the Enterprise Investment Scheme, investors
can claim up to £150,000 tax reduction on their investments each year and
founders have access to up to £10m in tax relief when they sell their company.

Research and development tax credits are particularly useful for start-ups and
small companies because they offer real cash from the tax man at a stage when
they are still unprofitable (as most early-stage companies are for quite some
time) or tax credits when money is being made. These can be claimed against
employee salaries as well as expenditure, which means the amount can be a
significant help to cashflow. Those employees who take the risk associated with
joining an early-stage company in the UK can be granted advantaged share options
up to a value of £125,000, to be taxed under capital gains rather than income
tax.

For foreigners wanting to start a company in the UK from outside the European
Economic Area (EEA), a new entrepreneur visa was created in 2011, which can be
granted with just £50,000 of UK-based investment. Of course, EEA residents are
free to relocate as they wish and once your company is based in the UK you can
access various services throughout the world wherever the UK has an embassy
through UK Trade & Investment, the government’s export support agency. The help
here ranges from localised advice and introductions to important, high-level
contacts to subsidised trade missions and full support services like market
reports, or even making use of embassy facilities to hold events.

So why don’t more UK-based entrepreneurs celebrate our good fortune? I believe
it is in part because so much media coverage focuses on the success stories from
the US. As a result, many people believe that you have to be in Silicon Valley
or New York to run a start-up in 2012.

I don’t agree with this. Spotify, Mind Candy, Canonical, Moo and Songkick are
UK-based start-ups that are international success stories in high-growth mode.
Even Silicon Valley Bank, a specialist hi-tech investment bank with £13bn in
assets, recently opened its first branch outside the US in London.

The US still remains well known for high-profile “start-ups gone big” like
Apple, Google, Facebook and Salesforce.com but the UK is now particularly well
positioned to attract and support the right type of talent to create the same
kind of businesses. In my opinion, the UK is not just a good place for start-ups
– it is the best.
