I've been running monthly board meetings for Server Density since 2015
which [was when we brought on an institutional
investor.](https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/10/server-density/) My board now
comprises of the VC partner ([Barnaby
Terry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barnaby-terry-98053227/)), my first angel
investor ([Qamar Aziz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qamar-aziz-03182261/)) and an
independent ([Oren Michels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omichels/)).

Although it's well established that employees should have regular performance
reviews, this isn't widely heard of when it comes to evaluating the CEO
performance. In much larger businesses, compensation can be linked to stock
price or other KPIs, but at a startup or small business it can be harder.
Feedback often needs to be qualitative as well as quantitative.

You might implement a [360 degree feedback
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback) within the
management team but a formal opportunity for feedback from the board to the CEO
is rare. This might only surface through scrutiny of specific board agenda
items, difficult questions or ultimately being fired!

With this in mind, an idea I have been using for some time is a specific section
of the board meeting where I leave the room and allow the remainder of the board
to discuss without me present. This is a good opportunity for them to discuss
the meeting topics themselves but I specifically frame it around "Feedback to
the CEO". This lasts 10-15 minutes, after which I'm called back in.

Despite the board members not being in the day-to-day so less able to provide
specific operational direction, I have found the feedback very useful. It has
allowed me to direct my thinking on difficult topics, understand how I might
change my approach to problems and reconsider where I should be spending my
time.

Positive feedback is just as useful as negative. I know [many CEOs suffer from
imposter syndrome](https://blog.asmartbear.com/self-doubt-fraud.html) so being
given praise is valuable as well. You should try and bring on board members who
have been CEOs themselves, so they understand the difficulties. Feedback is so
much more valuable when it is from someone who can relate to the experience.

If you're not getting feedback from your board, you're missing out on a big part
of why they're supposed to be there.

The most important piece of advice I've learned on structuring board meetings is
that they should be discussions without fear of conflict. Just using the meeting
as a status update is a waste of everyone's time and incredibly boring.
