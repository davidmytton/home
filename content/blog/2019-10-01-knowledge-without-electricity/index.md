I just finished reading [The Second
Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43561172-the-second-sleep), the
latest book by Robert Harris. [Last year every fiction title I rated 5 stars was
by Harris](https://davidmytton.blog/my-favourite-books-of-2018/), so I was
looking forward to it.

What is different about The Second Sleep is how it looks into the future rather
than being historical fiction like most of his other books. Indeed, it is set
almost 1,000 years after an unspecified apocalypse where the church has been
revitalised as the dominant organisation at the centre of everyone’s life.

There is historical precedent for civilisation collapse. Pretty much every
society has failed for various reasons. Examining past civilisations shows an
average lifespan of 336 years with most disappearing entirely. Some such as the
Chinese and Egyptian transformed into different societies and others like Rome
were revived into other countries.

![The Lifespans of Ancient Civilisations](lifespan-of-civilizations.png "[The Lifespans of Ancient Civilisations](https://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190218-the-lifespans-of-ancient-civilisations-compared)")

Early in the book the main character, Fairfax, comes across an old letter
written by a scientist predicting 6 scenarios:

> Imperial College, London, 22 March 2022  
> Dear Colleague  
> …  
> Three months ago I formed, with a group of like-minded colleagues, a working

>    …

The Second Sleep does not explain what caused the apocalypse but instead
suggests several possible triggers. Despite the letter, what these scenarios
might be are unknown to the characters. Concepts such as cyber warfare and
antibiotics are as foreign in the time the book is set in as they would have
been before they were invented.

The angle Harris considered is somewhat unusual due to how far in the future it
is. The nature of these apocalyptic triggers remain a mystery to the characters
because so much knowledge has been lost. His contention is that we rely so much
on electronic means of knowledge that should we lose access to our computer
systems, we will have lost all ability to exist as a the civilisation we know.

In this post I wanted to consider how much we actually rely on computer
technologies and what the risks might actually be.

## Risks and contingency planning

Flooding. Car accidents. Crime. Governments have extensive contingency plans in
place for a wide range of different scenarios.

Just researching where I live, [London has 13 detailed planning
documents](https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/london-prepared/planning-emergencies-capital#acc-i-43126) for
situations ranging from pandemic to building collapse. The London Risk Register
plots out many more scenarios and explains their likelihood, impact, and the
mitigation planning that is in place.

![London Risk Register 2019: High Level Summary Matrix](london-risk-register-2019.png "[London Risk Register 2019: High Level Summary Matrix](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_risk_register_2019.pdf)")

Although several of the scenarios in the letter appear on the risk register,
Harris is actually writing about something a bit more subtle: the loss of
knowledge due to our reliance on computer systems, all of which require
electricity.

As interesting as they are, the specific scenarios that cause the apocalypse are
less relevant. The real, long lasting damage is actually inflicted by the loss
of electricity which follows. It is “_the transfer of so much economic and
social activity to cyberspace_” which introduces this un-planned-for fragility
into the global system.

## H41: Systems Failure – National Electricity Transmission

Examining the London Risk Register, the key risk highlighted by The Second Sleep
is is H41: National Electricity Transmission.

Consider how much of your life requires electricity and you will realise why
this is categorised at the highest impact level in the register. Just thinking
about my usage of electricity today explains why this is categorised at the
highest impact level in the register.

My phone charged overnight to instruct my watch to buzz to wake me up (which I
then charged after getting out bed). I used an electric kettle to make tea and
ate yoghurt that was stored in an electric fridge. The water in the shower was
heated through a boiler that requires electricity to ignite and run the
electronic control board. I checked my email using a laptop and router connected
to fibre equipment in the street cabinet, all powered by electricity. I read a
book on a Kindle that was charged and was then reminded about a school meeting
by my phone. I had to cross the road using electric traffic lights and the
school security system is powered by electric door locks. My mobile phone
connected to a cell tower, connected to the internet backhaul to a central data
centre, all powered by electricity.

And this only brought me to lunch time!

We all rely on the electricity grid to provide electricity on demand, any time
of the day or night. It’s a crucial aspect of our lives and we have zero control
over it.

So what could we expect in a system failure of the electricity grid? What is
scenario H41?

>
> <cite>[London Risk Register
> 2019](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_risk_register_2019.pdf)</cite>

This is assessed as a 3 in the likelihood category which means the chances of it
happening in the next 5 years are > 0.5% i.e. there is a 1 in 200 chance. To put
this into perspective, the threat of conventional attacks on the transport
system are considered to be in category 5 of likelihood i.e. there is a 1 in 2
chance of such an attack happening in the next 5 years.

### What does history tell us about major electricity failures?

The UK has never seen a country-wide electricity failure. The [National Risk
Register stated in
2017](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644968/UK_National_Risk_Register_2017.pdf):

> a national blackout has never happened. A much less severe incident did occur
> between 22 and 28 December 2013 when, as a result of two severe winter storms
> and consequent damage to the distribution overhead line network, around
> 900,000 UK customers suffered a loss of electricity. 876,000 customers had
> power restored within 24 hours, however 16,000 experienced disruption for

> edition](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644968/UK_National_Risk_Register_2017.pdf)

Since then there have been several other major electricity outages, such as the
2019 blackout which affected over 1m people:

> Large parts of England and Wales suffered power cuts on Friday night after a
> major network failure, affecting around 1m people and causing widespread

> 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/d0feb744-bac5-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c)</cite>

Although these incidents are inconvenient, they generally last just a few hours
for most people. Blackouts in other countries have not been resolved so quickly.
New York saw several days of problems following Hurricane Sandy in 2012:

> <cite>[Why New York City Is On the Verge of

And [the US suffered an outage affecting 50m people in
2003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd3teNgUq8E).

More recent outages have lasted between [a few
hours](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/nyregion/nyc-blackout-con-edison.html) and [a
whole
day](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/22/new-york-city-power-outage-con-edison-restoring-power-brooklyn/1792877001/).
But what happens if there is a national outage which lasts longer?

## Black start

Clearly we have been able to survive short outages but when so much of society
runs on electricity, what happens if it is no longer available for prolonged
periods of time?

In the event of a major electricity outage, you would be unable to connect to
the internet because your router would be down and power to the street cabinets
that run the fibre network would also be offline. The old-fashioned telephone
network is resilient to failure for up to 5 days but the mobile phone network
would fail within 2 hours.

Within 2-6 hours all public communication except BBC Radio 4 would stop and
within 12-48 hours, the water supply would also fail ([London Power Supply
Disruption Framework Oct 2018
p8](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_power_supply_disruption_framework_v3.1_october_2018.pdf)).

Consider how much of your work involves services you have no control over. You
need electricity for your laptop to turn on, to connect to a wireless network
which provides internet access to servers hosted in a data centre somewhere in
the cloud. How much do you actually have stored locally?

> <cite>[The Second Sleep, Robert

The worst case scenario is a nationwide outage that requires a cold start of the
national power generating infrastructure:

> if the whole of the network, including the power stations supplying the
> national high voltage electricity distribution network (the grid), loses
> power, you would need to restart those individual power stations before they
> can get the grid powered up again.

> <cite>[Black start: the most important back up plan you’ve never heard

Such a scenario may require up to 7 days to restore full service with days 2-7
involving rolling blackouts (3 hours of power):

> UK Power Networks have set out the phases to restore the national power
> network from the time of the outage to the full restoration of the network.
> The actual restoration timeframe could vary, depending on the cause of the

> progressively restart the rest of the network. In this scenario, London could
> be one of the last regions to be reconnected.

![London Power Supply Disruption Framework: Black Start Restoration Timeline](black-start-restoration-timeline.png "[London Power Supply Disruption Framework: Black Start Restoration Timeline](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_power_supply_disruption_framework_v3.1_october_2018.pdf)")

A national black start has never been required but it was used regionally in
1987:

> In October 1987, there was a regional Black Start in the wake of the powerful
> hurricane that hit the south of the country. The storm damage left Kent and
> Sussex disconnected from the National Grid – but thanks to Black Start
> contingency plans, most people barely noticed. Kingsnorth Power Station
> restored power to the area and it ran independently, cut off from the rest of
> the Grid, until repairs enabled it to be connected up again.
>
> <cite>[Black start: the most important back up plan you’ve never heard
> of](https://www.drax.com/technology/black-start-important-back-plan-youve-never-heard/)</cite>

The fact that a national outage has never happened should provide some
reassurance. In London, the power network has seen improving reliability year
over year:

![UK Power Networks Performance](uk-power-networks-performance.png "[UK Power Networks Performance 2018](https://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/annualreview2018/#/focus-areas/network-reliability)")

But it is not business as usual that we need to worry about. It’s exceptional
events that pose challenges for contingency planning.

[Storm
David](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/storm-david) with
wind speeds of 71-93MPH in January 2018 is the most recent example of
weather-based disruption and power was restored to 99% of customers in 24 hours.
UK Power Networks (who are responsible for the electricity distribution in
London and the South) deployed 1,000 additional staff and answered over 16,000
calls with an average time to answer of 5 seconds, 10 times the number of calls
received in a normal day
([source](https://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/annualreview2018/static/pdfs/focus--network-reliability.5181142.pdf)).
This shows that contingency planning is in place and has been successfully
deployed in the recent past.

But what would be the impact of a longer duration of power outage, or permanent
loss?

## How do you access knowledge without electricity?

It seems sensible to digitise everything. [I
read](https://davidmytton.blog/a-healthy-reading-diet-removing-the-junk/) non-fiction
on my Kindle because I like to highlight and save notes (also electronically, in
Apple Notes). All my records and files are kept on encrypted storage locally,
sync’d via iCloud Drive and backed up
to [B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) using [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/).
And using WhatsApp and email means all my communication is electronic as well
([although they auto-delete after a
time](https://davidmytton.blog/email-is-not-a-good-database/)).

Consider how you look up information on a daily basis. Whether it is Wikipedia
or another site from web search, everything starts electronically. Even if you
end up reading a book or a research paper, how often do you use the services of
your local librarian to help research? And what do they use to search on your
behalf?

Library usage is declining ([although that trend may be
slowing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/analysing-data-cipfa-statistics-and-the-future-of-englands-libraries/analysing-data-cipfa-statistics-and-the-future-of-englands-libraries)),
but that doesn’t mean investments aren’t being made. The British Library is a
great example of a long term vision being put into action as the largest and
oldest copyright library in the world.

> The British Library is the custodian of one of the largest cultural heritage
> collections in the world. With more than 150 million items in both physical
> and digital formats, the collection grows rapidly, with 8km of physical items
> and 150Tb of digital items for long-term preservation being added every year.

> <cite>[BL North](https://www.bl.uk/projects/bl-north)</cite>

Whether it is improvements to the famous [British Library London St Pancras
site](https://www.bl.uk/projects/building-the-future) or the expansion of [BL
North](https://www.bl.uk/projects/bl-north) where a large volume of items are
stored, libraries can be considered not just sites for research
and [engagement](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/neil-gaiman-future-libraries-reading-daydreaming) but
also a crucial [physical backup of
knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB2hKfJxRrc).

Other organisations, such as the [Long Now
Foundation](http://longnow.org/about/), are attempting to tackle the problem of
durable long term storage.

Think about the technology that was in use for file storage over the last 10-20
years. [VHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS) – players no longer easily
available ([production ceased in
2016](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/07/vcr-vhs-production-ends/)). [Zip
disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_drive) – a proprietary format no longer
in mainstream usage. CD – laptops are rapidly ditching drives (I’ve not owned a
computer with a CD drive for at least 5 years now).

Not only do we need to think about the format the data is stored in but also the
media it is stored on. There’s a reason why [all UK legislation was printed on
vellum until
2015](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7451) (now
on archival paper).

## Space weather

Since the last major space weather event ([The Carrington Event of
1859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859)), the world has become
significantly more reliant upon digital storage of information. Electrical
failure generally means that systems are unavailable right now, but they will
come back online soon when the electricity supply is restored. Space weather
poses an additional risk of permanent data loss.

Space weather is listed as a medium risk (3) and high impact (4) on the London
Risk Register, also being present in similar categories on the UK National Risk
Register. Caused by solar flares, solar energetic particles and coronal mass
ejections, it can cause major disruption to electricity grids:

> **H56: Space Weather**  
> Disruption to the electricity grid, resulting in two rural/coastal sub-station
> disconnections each effecting communities of approx. 100,000 people, with loss
> of power for 1 month or more and rota-disconnections for a further 1 month or
> more. Voltage instability may also result in local blackouts, most likely in
> urban areas lasting a few hours.
>
> <cite>[London Risk Register
> 2019](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_risk_register_2019.pdf)</cite>

It can also cause problems with key systems like GPS, communication networks and
even cause data loss to sensitive storage equipment.

> The Carrington Event in 1859 is the largest space weather event on record.
> Telegraph systems were heavily disrupted and the *Aurora Borealis* was sighted
> as far south as Mexico, the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.
>
> Other significant space weather events have been recorded since then. A
> Carrington-scale CME was measured by the Stereo-A satellite in July 2012. The
> path this took from the Sun narrowly missed the Earth. A smaller storm in 1989
> tripped the equipment protection systems of the Hydro-Québec electricity

> edition](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644968/UK_National_Risk_Register_2017.pdf)</cite>

The UK Met Office provide [space weather forecasting
services](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/space-weather) and
the electricity industry already use shielding to protect equipment. There is [a
detailed government preparedness
strategy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/449593/BIS-15-457-space-weather-preparedness-strategy.pdf) even
though the annual probability of a Carrington level event is low at just 1%.

## Practical conclusions

It is sensible to take personal precautions to the same degree that well run
technical projects plan for [system
problems](https://davidmytton.blog/what-are-the-common-causes-of-cloud-outages/).
In cloud infrastructure this means deploying across multiple zones and regions,
regularly testing backups and failover plans and building for failure.

Deploying across multiple regions is essential to mitigate the risks discussed
here. Geographies matter. Your regional backup needs to be sufficiently diverse
to be outside of localised (earth and space) weather as well as resilient to
electricity grid failure. This typically means deploying in different countries
on different continents.

The largest companies do extensive disaster planning, [such as Google simulating
the loss of its HQ](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371516) and how that
impacts the operations of the rest of the company. And emergency services
also [run large scale
simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owL3UQr4-ls) for training.

These are quite extreme for individuals, especially when the likelihood of being
impacted by such an event is very low. Instead, small scale planning is prudent
for individuals.

Considering the risks discussed above, dealing with electricity loss for several
days (up to a week) is a reasonable worse case scenario. [The US Government has
a whole website](https://www.ready.gov/) with practical advice [such as keeping
a supply of water and
food](https://www.ready.gov/kids/family-emergency-planning/build-a-kit) and the
London website also suggests things like [having a grab bag
ready](https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/organisations-we-work/london-prepared/preparing-yourself-and-your-community-emergencies),
which should include non-digital essentials like a map of your local area.

![Tweet by @polscotcontrol](tweet-polscotcontrol-1170645529686134784.png "[Tweet by @polscotcontrol](https://twitter.com/polscotcontrol/status/1170645529686134784)")

This is not about building a nuclear bunker ([and some do think it is
scaremongering](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-49631455)) but taking
simple and sensible precautions to ensure you don’t run out of critical supplies
– water being the most important.

Once you have taken care of the essentials, you can turn to your digital assets.

The beauty of online document products like Google Docs are that all the
complexity of sync and storage is abstracted away. Do you understand how the
critical systems you rely on actually work? Are you satisfied that your online
documents are properly replicated across multiple regions? Remember that backup
is not the same as sync and files that appear on your computer may actually just
be links to the cloud version (as is the case with Google Drive).

Where are your photos, files and documents? Does this include statements for
your new, mobile-only bank? Do you understand how those files are represented
and synced? Do you have backups? How can they be accessed if the service is
down? What about all those messages from family that have sentimental value?

What is your black start scenario plan?

Of course this is all very unlikely but the difference is that instead of
relying on a government that is legally required to make (and publish)
contingency plans, all our digital assets tend to be held by private entities.
The cloud and SaaS has many benefits, and this is not an argument against
either, but it is prudent to consider whether you really understand how these
systems actually work. What are your assumptions about their availability? How
much are you relying on them?
