“Prosumer” has had several definitions. Broadly, it can mean someone who both
consumes and produces a product. This is [used in
energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/consumer-vs-prosumer-whats-difference) to
refer to someone who both consumes and produces their own electricity.

It can also mean a “pro” or “power” user of a particular software tool. Someone
who uses that tool so often that particular features are designed to help them
be more efficient can be called a “prosumer”. It is this definition that this
article focuses on.

As a buyer segment for existing products, prosumer software has been around for
some time:

> A couple of years ago the “prosumer” model was really hot among SaaS
> investors. Prosumers ( professional + consumer) are individuals who buy
> “professional software” either for their use or their activity as freelancers
> / solopreneurs.

> Clement Vouillon.</cite>

Think Photoshop for amateur photographers or Final Cut Pro for YouTubers. These
are professional-grade products but used by amateurs to get professional quality
output. They can be purchased by amateurs (helped by the industry trend away
from high one-time licenses to monthly subscriptions), but are not specifically
designed for them. Sometimes the output becomes popular, and the user may
graduate to being paid professionally for their content.

As discussed by Clement Vouillon in his 2017 post quoted above, this
segmentation of customer has its challenges. Scaling user acquisition is hard,
virility is crucial and the “expand” aspect of “land and expand” for B2B sales
is very difficult.

## Pure prosumer products

Conscious of those challenges, a new trend is emerging – pure proconsumer
products. Instead of creating a segment (and pricing/feature package) of an
existing product, new products are being developed purely targeted at the
prosumer.

Prosumers are not the mainstream user. They are the top % who use a product
extensively, often for hours at a time. These are the users where marginal
improvements to things like speed and efficiency have a meaningful impact on
their time and productivity.

The email startup, [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/), is a good example.
They are focused on people who spend hours in their inbox. [This is a renewed
approach to software
design](https://toddgoldberg.com/posts/superhuman-of-x-startups.html) focused on
product features such as speed, specific workflows, keyboard shortcuts and
minimal design. The opposite of the trend towards heavier websites.

Product development is just half of building a successful startup. A common
mistake I see startups make is a failure to think about the other half:
commercial go-to-market approach. The best founder teams have both commercial
and technical founders.

Given how important this trend, I wanted to look at the pure prosumer software
commercial go-to-market approach in more detail using two new prosumer email
products as case
studies: [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/) and [Hey.com](https://hey.com/).

## Limited access

If you remember the launch of GMail, it was originally invite-only and each user
has a limited number to give out. I remember invites being sold on eBay for
large sums of money! This limited access helped to build buzz around the product
because of its scarcity. If you had access, you weren’t likely to keep quiet
about it.

![Screensot of a GMail invite](gmail-invite-a-friend.jpg "GMail invite ([Ask
Dave
Taylor](https://www.askdavetaylor.com/how_do_i_invite_people_to_join_gmail/)).")

Using a wait-list has multiple benefits:

- As a technical measure to avoid overloading your service on day one. Gradually
  let people in to ensure your systems scale.
- So you can show off about how many people you have waiting for access. This is
  a great way to demonstrate demand to investors.
- As a way to reduce the chances of early user churn. Let people in gradually
  then get their feedback and improve before allowing others to join. This
  prevents everyone signing up at once, being disappointed, and never coming
  back again.
- Allow existing users to offer invites to their friends. That makes the inviter
  feel like they have special access and feel smug about helping their friends
  skip the queue. It’s like being on the guest list at a club because you “know
  someone”.
- You can see who is on the list and prioritise access based on their audience
  size to create influencer buzz.

## Creating influencer buzz

Word of mouth has always been an important discovery channel. In the past that
meant a small group of early adopters sharing links. Today it means audiences of
hundreds of thousands or millions following particular individuals they trust.
Whether that is [mkbhd](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee) for his
tech gear reviews, [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/) for his health and
productivity hacks or [Oprah Winfrey for her book
club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah%27s_Book_Club), individuals now have
promotional power like never before.

If you combine this with a wait list and limited details about the product then
you can generate significant buzz that is both targeted to a specific audience
but widely distributed due to the audience size.

For example, Hey.com hasn’t even launched yet but they have over 40,000 people
on their waiting list. Basecamp, the company behind it, have their own audience
built up over years of strong opinions and writing on topics such as [VC
investors](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/reconsider-41adf356857f) and [remote
work](https://basecamp.com/books/remote). However, they can still broaden their
reach using tech influencers.

Note how the tweet mentions the product and how they think their audience will
love it, but does not contain any real information. It’s the definition of a
teaser!

## Keep people guessing

As Superhuman has grown, they have shown more and more of the product, but their
website is still a single page with very few details.

The Hey.com website is even lighter, [focusing on the
problems](https://hey.com/problems-with-email/) they want to solve without (yet)
explaining how they are solving them. This helps readers think about their
problems and build up an expectation about how they think Hey.com will solve
them.

In the lead up to the launch, drips of information have been let out.

Just a small screenshot here:

Asking Twitter what they would like to see:

@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1263097298625662976)")

Before posting another screenshot there:

@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1263481125021810690)")

Influencer buzz creates a large, one-time surge, so regular snippets of
information keeps people engaged and builds up the excitement over a longer
period if time. Jason has been good at responding to questions, often in a
non-committal way without revealing too much but at the same time expressing
specific opinions about how the product has been designed.

## Have an opinion

Knowing what not to build is as important as knowing what to build. Trying to
build software for everyone is too difficult for startups to tackle.

This will mean having strict eligibility criteria based on your target customer
and turning down people who want specific features. Maybe you will add them
later:

![Screenshot of a tweet by @jasonfried](tweet-jasonfried-1263481125021810690.png "Screenshot of [a tweet by
@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1263481125021810690)")

Either way, you need to know what the first version will do and ensure that of
the few things it does, it will be the best.

## Strict eligibility criteria

Designing for a specific user allows you to get a small number of highly
engaged, evangelist users. This is [the purpose of customer
success](https://davidmytton.blog/what-is-the-difference-between-customer-success-and-account-management/) –
ensuring that once the product is bought, it is deployed and used. In the early
days, that means strict filtering based on eligibility criteria.

The onboarding process for Superhuman requires you filling out a lengthy form
which asks questions such as what OS you use and whether you use multiple
inboxes for multiple accounts. These are based on the product capabilities,
because it doesn’t yet support Windows or a unified inbox. Anyone who needs
those features is flagged and told they will be in touch when the product
supports their needs. This avoids disappointments because of missing
functionality and helps reach product market fit.

Not everyone wants to go through rigorous onboarding though. Knowing your
audience allows you to pick which of these go-to-market approaches make sense.

For example, developers are notoriously against opaque sales processes and
prefer to self-serve. [Linear](https://linear.app/) is an issue tracking product
built around similar principles as Superhuman, but for engineers and techies.
The product is similarly focused on minimalist design and speed, but has avoided
high-touch onboarding.

For new startups, think about the type of person you want as a customer, what
characteristics they have and what problems you want to solve for them.

Then figure out what your product will and will not do. Filtering users based on
those criteria will ensure you get the best fit with the early adopters. Knowing
what users want the product to do in the future helps direct your roadmap and
gives you a ready-made list of people to contact when/if those features are
released.

## Charge money

Prosumers have both the means and willingness to pay for the product. Superhuman
doesn’t even let you sign up for their onboarding without entering a credit
card. You get charged on day one, although they offer a refund guarantee if
you’re not happy.

![Screenshot of a tweet by @dhh](tweet-dhh-1246211236640862209.png "Screenshot
of [a tweet by @dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1246211236640862209)")

Mainstream users are used to getting software for free, although they are paying
in other ways. Usually their privacy, or through ads. Prosumers are people who
will pay for software (and probably expense it). This is an important filter. If
your product offers significant value, such as making it fast to power through
your email, users will be willing to pay. Anyone who complains about the price
is not a good fit.

Traditional wisdom says that you should make it easy for users to sign up –
minimal form fields, don’t ask for a credit card, self-service access. Prosumer
software flips those around. Long eligibility criteria. Pay before you can
access. Manual onboarding.

## Conclusions

A startup has two equally important components: product and commercial. Each is
necessary but not sufficient by itself.

Equal time should be put into the commercial go-to-market approach **and** the
product design and development. Startups need both technical and commercial
co-founders. Indeed, this is one of my strict investing criteria for
the startups I’ve invested in.

Superhuman has demonstrated that there is a large market for specialised,
prosumer software and Hey.com is a case study in how to launch something new
into a crowded space.

Products cannot be successful without a deliberate commercial go-to-market
approach. Pure prosumer software might be new but the fundamentals haven’t
changed.
