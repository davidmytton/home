It was once sufficient to build software based on features. Buyers compared
functionality and picked the product that did what they wanted, or what they
thought they wanted. This worked when software was new. It’s what we have in
Word, Excel, Outlook, and is why they maintain their market lead despite the
bloat. Everyone uses Excel because it is so flexible.

It was also once sufficient to build software based on the delivery model. In
the early 2010s, SaaS was new. Most software was still on-premise and licensed.
This was what made my company, Server Density, different from all its
competitors – server monitoring as a service. [Today, SaaS is the
default](https://davidmytton.blog/the-golden-age-of-saas/). No modern company
wants to run software outside of a few specific niches related to security and
IP protection e.g. source code management. Even then, [you can’t do security
better than Amazon, Google and
Microsoft](https://davidmytton.blog/3-hybrid-cloud-myths/).

A startup cannot hope to compete with the features of the incumbent products.
SaaS is the standard.

So how do you differentiate today?

## Make opinionated software

Word, Excel and Outlook do not have an opinion about how to use them. You can do
anything you like, your own way, even the wrong way – Word has [only just
started](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234170/microsoft-word-two-spaces-period-error-correction-great-space-debate) highlighting
double spaces as grammatically incorrect.

This is mainstream software targeting the masses, but there are still market
opportunities. The software market is now so large that even niches are highly
lucrative.

Basecamp is one of the oldest examples. The
co-founders, [David](https://twitter.com/dhh) and [Jason](https://twitter.com/jasonfried),
are very vocal about many issues from [remote
work](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) to [raising venture
capital](https://dhh.dk/2019/we-need-counter-capital.html). They also believe
in [opinionated
software](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/04.6-make-opinionated-software) and
have adopted a specific approach to how they build their products. If you use
Basecamp, have you ever contacted them to request a feature? Don’t bother.

Having an opinion doesn’t mean ignoring customers. It means having a vision and
then building a product for people who share that view.

## Innovative opinions

Making opinionated software is the way to break into a crowded market with
something unique. You can’t build an Excel competitor by copying all the
functionality of a product that has been around since 1987. So how do you
innovate?

Office 365 has come a long way but if you’ve ever had to work on a Word document
with multiple people at the same time, you will have experienced merge
conflicts, upload errors and weird bugs. Contrast that with Google Docs which
has flawless sharing and collaboration. It might come nowhere near the level of
functionality of Word, but there is nothing better.

Google’s opinion is cloud-first. This shows in their other products.

For example, AWS allows you to configure everything and anything. This is why
its APIs and Console are so complex. Contrast with Google Cloud which gives you
relatively few options but is best in class for large scale computing products
that it pioneered, like Kubernetes.

Google Cloud is built for customers who want to run their infrastructure like
Google. AWS is built for customers who want to run their infrastructure how they
like.

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a startup innovating on the spreadsheet.
They have considered the common uses of Excel – calculations – and databases –
storing information – then combined them. They are not targeting finance, who do
need Excel for modeling. Or developers, who will still use Postgres or MongoDB.
Airtable is the spreadsheet database for non-technical users. Note how
their [use cases](https://airtable.com/inspiration) are defined for
non-technical teams like marketing, UX and project management. A redefined
audience for an existing product group.

## E-mail is not done

E-mail is seeing a similar wave of innovation. You might think that e-mail is
“done”. Everyone uses GMail or Outlook. These are mass market products catering
to [billions](https://www.axios.com/google-g-suite-total-users-9a6d3df6-c990-4866-9efc-ba6756ba3c4d.html) of
users which work well if you don’t get many e-mails. But what about people who
spend hours in their inbox? [GMail is
slow](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/) and doesn’t help you organise
messages very well. Outlook is bloated and has a confusing UI.

This is where [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/) stands out. It is
laser-focused on people who spend more than 3 hours on e-mail per day, and has
gamified the inbox so users aim to get through their messages [as quickly as
possible](https://toddgoldberg.com/posts/superhuman-of-x-startups.html) to hit
Inbox Zero only using keyboard shortcuts. Superhuman is a product for
the [prosumer](https://a16z.com/2019/06/27/superhuman/) willing to pay $30/m to
be more productive. [It’s working
well](https://twitter.com/SuperhumanCo/timelines/911278863216340992).

But e-mail still isn’t done.

The Basecamp team announced [Hey.com](https://hey.com/), another e-mail service.
It hasn’t launched yet so there are no details on what it looks like or how it
works, but they have [posted a manifesto of 25 issues with e-mail
today](https://hey.com/problems-with-email/). This ranges from complaints about
poor subject lines to annoyingly long threads and they have been successful in
generating buzz from tech influencers:

![Screenshot of a tweet from @kevinrose](tweet-kevinrose.png "I just got an early demo of Hey (https://hey.com) from @jasonfried. I can confirm this will be my new default email over Gmail...it's a beautiful rethinking of everything wrong with email. I can't wait for you all to play with it soon. [From @kevinrose](https://twitter.com/kevinrose/status/1246199723922354176).")

![Screenshot of a tweet from @om](tweet-om.png "[Hey hey](https://om.co/2020/04/22/hey-hey/)")

Will they convert most GMail users? No, especially since it will be a paid
product. But it doesn’t need to. They can compete with the incumbents and
co-exist with other startups because enough people hate their email in the same
way. That’s the power of having an opinion.

## What does that mean for your new startup?

Incremental improvements are insufficient. Startups don’t have the resources to
compete on features and SaaS is not innovative. Tackling an existing market
requires a unique opinion that can be the company mission. [As explained by Jobs
Theory](https://davidmytton.blog/tools-for-evaluating-startup-business-ideas/):

> Creating the right experiences and then integrating around them to solve a

This follows the classic insight from Peter Thiel:

> “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”
>
> <cite>Masters, Blake & Thiel, Peter, Zero to One</cite>

“Very few” can be relative. It can still amount to hundreds of thousands of
people. Can you build opinionated software based on that important truth?
