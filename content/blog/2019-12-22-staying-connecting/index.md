summary: "When was the last time you spoke to your manager's manager or your 
company CEO? You can only effectively manage 7-10 people so this post explores 
how you can stay in touch (with customers and employees) as your organisation 
grows."

As companies grow, more responsibilities get delegated. The team gets larger and
the distance between the CEO and the lowest level employee expands. Same with
customers. Front line support takes over, shielding engineering and management
from direct contact with users.

This is a challenge for startup CEOs. Weekly one to ones with every employee
eventually become impossible. At some point it becomes impractical to read every
incoming support email. But as this becomes more difficult, it becomes more
important.

When was the last time you, as an employee, spoke to the CEO or your manager’s
manager? When was the last time you, as the CEO or manager, spoke with a
customer, and not just the top accounts?

The CEO is always the last person in the company to know about a problem. If
someone is thinking about leaving, if there is a major bug, if a big customer is
planning to churn, you can bet that it is already well known within the
organisation. [Communication is
hard](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/).

It is impossible to completely solve this but as the CEO or as a manager, you
must still work to stay connected to your organisation.

## Staying “in touch” as a manager or CEO

- [One to ones](https://a16z.com/2012/08/30/one-on-one/) are crucial to
  understanding your direct reports, but [there is an upper limit of about
  7-10 people you can effectively
  manage](https://hbr.org/2012/04/how-many-direct-reports). Any more direct
  reports than that and you have to sacrifice quality. Weekly one to ones
  become difficult to schedule and poor managers end up cancelling or making
  them more infrequent. This is fixed by reducing the number direct reports by
  adding a new management layer but this increases the distance between you
  and the front line workers. You must still meet with as many of your team as
  possible, just less frequently. This is known as the [skip level
  meeting](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/skip-level-meetings-what-they-are-and-exactly-how-to-run-them/) and
  applies across reporting lines as well as within your own organisation. At
  large companies it will eventually become impossible to meet every employee
  but you should still speak to a representative sample across all teams.
- In a small startup it is easy for everyone to do support but this becomes
  difficult when you have hundreds or thousands of customers. At my old
  company, Server Density, even though we had a dedicated support team,
  everyone received the initial “new ticket” notification with details of the
  opening issue. This worked at 20 people and 10-20 tickets per day. At larger
  companies, you can do things like sending out summary reports of top
  reported issues and rotating everyone into the support team for a week a
  year. This is especially important for engineers building products so they
  get to understand their user’s problems. [Good quality writing is a crucial
  skill](https://davidmytton.blog/writing-as-a-core-company-value/) and
  communicating with customers is a great way to practice.
- After the early stages, one of the few things the CEO should be focused on
  is speaking to new and existing customers. The CEO is the ultimate
  salesperson and after product-market fit, their involvement in deals is
  usually limited to [the biggest and most important
  customers](https://www.saastr.com/have-you-visited-your-top-5-customers-this-year-well-its-june-book-the-flights/).
  However, it is still important to understand the full cross-section of your
  user-base, [not just the most valuable users only at steak
  dinners](https://twitter.com/jasonlk/status/564473754500075521). If [Jeff

  do this, so can you.
- Buy and use your own product. As the supply chain gets increasingly complex,
  there will be more opportunity for issues to creep in at various stages.
  Browse your own website. Attempt to sign up. Explore the onboarding and then
  buy with your own credit card. There may be multiple teams responsible for
  the various stages but the customer is only going to experience it as a
  single flow. [Have someone own the full delivery

  ensure it all ties together.
