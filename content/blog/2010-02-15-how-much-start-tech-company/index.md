_Originally [published on the Server Density
Blog](https://blog.serverdensity.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-start-a-tech-company/)._

The buzzword is bootstrapped. This means using your own funds to start a company
spending as little as possible, either until you generate revenue from customers
and/or you raise outside capital. One year ago I started playing with some
Python code to create our server monitoring tool, [Server
Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), and formed the company in April 2009
(on the 6th, specifically to coincide with the day the tax year starts), but how
much did it actually cost me?

The beginnings are always unsure – I was trying out an idea that I thought would
be fun to do, but could also be a good product. Funding everything from my own
bank account, I wanted to spend as little as possible to get to the stage where
people were willing to pay me. At that point I could decide whether to continue,
or withdraw.

The dates run from April 2009 – June 2009 (I backdated some expenses from the
previous months), so using the power of our awesome accounting
system, [Xero](http://www.xero.com/), let’s have a look at where the costs were.

## Total startup cost to get to revenue

£1,814.52 GBP / $2,902.87

## What’s missing?

The biggest cost is paying employees. That isn’t on the above figures because I
didn’t pay myself or my co-founder a salary (only expenses, as above). Although
a few of the items above could’ve been left out as unnecessary, they’re really
only minor costs compared to the amount you have to pay real people. This is
fine if you have lots of money (savings or external funding) but the best way to
bootstrap is to have technical co-founders who can do everything you need
(programming, design, graphics, etc) for equity and promise of an awesome
future.

The cost of people cannot be underestimated. It is significant and not paying
yourself/your co-founders only works for a short period of time. Eventually you
run out of money so you need to be generating revenue by then.

What if you can’t find co-founders with these skills? Look again. I think
everything should be done in house wherever possible (with a few exceptions like
legal, accounting, etc).

## Ongoing costs

That’ll be the subject of a future post, as getting to revenue is only the first
hurdle. Our costs are now quite different but we have the funding available to
cover them.
