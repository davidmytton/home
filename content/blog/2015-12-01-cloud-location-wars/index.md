With the public cloud, presence is a big deal. The number and location of cloud
data centers has a major impact on latency -- and because regulations may vary
widely from country to country, global scale demands global buildout. Within
Europe, for example, all data processing requires adherence to strict controls
over where customer data resides.

A portfolio of geographically dispersed data centers is now table stakes for the
big three public cloud providers: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and
Google Cloud Platform. Note that this is not a competition to build out the
greatest capacity -- AWS has a very long lead in that department. This is about
a race to meet the public cloud needs of customers wherever in the world they
may reside.

Not surprisingly, the size of the United States and its density of customers has
encouraged the major providers to create large numbers of "regions" -- that is,
geographic areas containing enough data centers to provide robust public cloud
service, including redundancy should a data center within a region go offline.
Take the two leading public cloud providers: AWS has four U.S. regions and Azure
has five U.S. regions, providing roughly equivalent geographical coverage (the
two define regions somewhat differently).

In recent weeks, we’ve seen AWS and Azure both [announce new and coming
regions](http://fortune.com/2015/11/11/microsoft-german-data-centers/) in the
United Kingdom, Germany, India, and South Korea. Asia has seen significant
expansion in the past few years, with AWS covering four geographies and Azure
now in nine, but all providers seem to be lagging in Europe. AWS had a single
region in Ireland for a long time, only recently launching Frankfurt. It’s about
time we’re seeing Azure and AWS launch a London region, bringing them to three
each.

## Titans clash as a new combatant rises

But now the location wars are really heating up. AWS and Azure are clearly
reacting to customer demand. Cloud is a core business: It generates billions of
dollars in revenue at decent margins for Amazon, and it's central to Microsoft's
strategy. Both companies have the resources and scale to deploy new points of
presence where they see new demand.

The effect of customer demand can be seen in the activities of AWS and Azure in
China. Both have specialized local offerings designed for companies in China
that are quite independent from their global product. This has been going on for
years, with little visibility to outsiders.

The wild card here is Google, which only recently launched a second U.S. region,
taking its grand total to four regions globally. Compare this to AWS’s 11
regions (with India, South Korea, and London announced) and Azure’s 20 regions.
Google has no operation in China (although it [may be in negotiations to
re-engage with that market](http://fortune.com/2015/09/04/google-china/)) and
the [majority of its data centers are in the United
States](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/index.html) (plus
four in Europe and two in Asia, but only one from each is part of the Cloud
Platform). This scope makes sense for Google as an advertising company, but it
doesn’t help Google Cloud Platform.

Google has the engineering talent, experience at scale, and capital resources to
be in the top tier. Moreover, the company has sent strong signals of its
seriousness recently: This month, senior vice president Urs Hölzle predicted
that [Google's cloud revenue would surpass that of its ad
businesses](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3006761/cloud-computing/googles-infrastructure-czar-predicts-cloud-business-will-outpace-ads-in-5-years.html) in
five years, and last week Google announced legendary [VMware co-founder Diane
Greene will head up Google
Cloud](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3006944/cloud-computing/google-hires-vmware-co-founder-as-cloud-chief-aims-for-enterprise-adoption.html).

Such aggressive moves are understandable because the public cloud will be
central to the future of business computing. Broad geographical diversity is
important for customers, so they can enjoy the best possible performance for
public cloud workloads and stay in compliance with their country's regulatory
requirements. Global location is a major frontier in the war to serve tomorrow's
enterprise customers.
