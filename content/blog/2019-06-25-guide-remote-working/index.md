When [I co-founded my company](https://davidmytton.blog/about/) in 2009, I had
no choice about whether I was going to be running a remote, distributed
business.

I was living in student accommodation, halfway through my second year at
university. Money was limited so I built the initial product with one of my
friends, bootstrapping the company from savings and then customer revenue. We
couldn’t afford an office, and were happy working from home anyway – much easier
to get to lectures on time!

Over the following 9 years, we grew the company on a remote-first, distributed
model. All our engineers worked remotely and [we only opened a physical office
after 3
years](https://blog.serverdensity.com/building-our-london-office-part-1/) so
that we could bring the London team together. Later this evolved to deliberately
building the commercial team in the office, but still operating using a
distributed model for engineering.

At the time (2009), there were very few companies doing the same thing. Remote
work was weird and rare. Most people commuted to an office.

That is still the majority of cases, but there are now companies operating at
significant scale in a mostly or entirely remote, distributed way.

It is becoming clearer that office-based jobs can be done more effectively from
home. It doesn’t work for everyone and remote working is not a magical cure to
all the problems of an office. Indeed, remote working has its own challenges but
it is becoming more desirable with clear benefits to both the employee and
employer.

I fell into this mode of working through necessity, figuring out what to do
through trial and error. This post is about how that worked and the lessons
learned scaling to 20+ people globally.

## Does working remotely work?

Yes, there are many of examples of successful companies operating on a remote,
distributed model. It is not an unusual way to work.

The number of remote workers in the US [grew by
79%](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=0) between
2005 and 2012. The US Government [issues annual reports on its approach to
teleworking](https://www.telework.gov/reports-studies/reports-to-congress/annual-reports/).
For fiscal year 2017, they report:

> improved attainment of goals in almost every area: improved employee
> attitudes; emergency preparedness; recruitment; retention; reduced employee
> commute miles; improved employee performance; and reduced real estate costs
>
> <cite>**[2018 Telework Report to
> Congress](https://www.telework.gov/reports-studies/reports-to-congress/2018-report-to-congress.pdf)**</cite>

Cost savings were also tracked:

> Over a quarter of Federal agencies were able to track some form of cost
> savings due to telework (29 percent). Those agencies increasingly reported
> cost savings achieved through telework, especially in the areas of
> transit/commuting, rent/office space, and reduced employee absences.
>
> <cite>**[2018 Telework Report to
> Congress](https://www.telework.gov/reports-studies/reports-to-congress/2018-report-to-congress.pdf)**</cite>

Similar effects have been studied in private companies, too:

> Nicholas Bloom and graduate student James Liang, who is also a cofounder of
> the Chinese travel website Ctrip, gave the staff at Ctrip’s call center the
> opportunity to volunteer to work from home for nine months. Half the
> volunteers were allowed to telecommute; the rest remained in the office as a

>
> <cite>[To Raise Productivity, Let More Employees Work from
> Home](https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home)</cite>

The evidence is there to show that remote working has tangible benefits. The
list of companies implementing this at scale is impressive.

## Examples of remote, distributed companies

One of the big challenges I faced growing my company was there were very few
businesses that were operating remote-first. Emphasis on “first”. There are
thousands of distributed companies – any business that has more than 1 office
has to deal with employees in different locations. However, whilst they might
use many of the tools you will find in a remote-first company, they still apply
office-based thinking to solving problems.

Today, we not only have startups adopting a remote-first model, there are
companies at large scale doing this successfully.

### Examples of remote, distributed companies: Automattic, GitLab, InVision, Zapier, Buffer and Basecamp

[Automattic](https://automattic.com/), the business behind WordPress, Jetpack
and many other projects, has been doing this for over 15 years. They are now
approaching 900 people.

> Much like WordPress sought to change the way we publish on the web, Automattic
> has set out to change the way we work. We are an entirely distributed company
> — with more than 800 employees working from more than 62 countries, and no
> physical headquarters. We are a company that works on, and for, the web.
>
> <cite>[About Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt/about/)</cite>

Another company doing this at scale is [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). They
have over 650 people working from 50 different countries, all-remote. To make
this work, they have also adopted a culture of transparency both internally and
externally. This has proven extremely helpful for sharing how they manage the
company and setting them up to be a shining example of how to run a remote
business.

At GitLab, everything is documented in a 2000+ page public handbook. From
their [all-remote
manifesto](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/) to [how they
manage hiring](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/) and [how their
customer success team
operate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/) is
covered. [Writing is key to success for all
businesses](https://davidmytton.blog/writing-as-a-core-company-value/%E2%80%8E) and
GitLab go one step further by sharing this so others can see what might work for
them.

Remote working has an influence on how your own products develop. Automattic
developed [the P2 theme](https://p2theme.com/) which is what they use internally
for communication. [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) have over 1,000
people working for them remotely, and this has influenced features in their own
products.

>
> <cite>[Building InVision Studio with a fully remote
> team](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/studio-remote-design-team/)</cite>

On the smaller side but still quite big (and
growing), [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) has over 100 people all working
remotely. Another tech startup offering a technical product, Zapier have written
extensively about how their company works and [how to succeed in a remote,
distributed model](https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/).

It’s not just companies selling to engineers or those in the same
industry. [Buffer is 80+
people](https://open.buffer.com/distributed-team-benefits/), all remote.
And [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about), one of the original remote-first
companies who’s founders wrote [Remote](https://basecamp.com/books/remote) all
about distributed work, are currently at around 50 people.

So is the remote, distributed model the future of w[ork? Matt Mullenweg of
Automattic certainly thinks so](https://youtu.be/x6fIseKzzH0).

## Core principles for a remote, distributed company

The tools used to run a remote, distributed company are relevant but you have to
apply some core principles first. A degree of process is necessary in any
company but is particularly important where remote work is concerned.

> These adjustments alone might result in minor improvements, but real change

> <cite>[Why Remote Work Thrives in Some Companies and Fails in
> Others](https://hbr.org/2015/03/why-remote-work-thrives-in-some-companies-and-fails-in-others)</cite>

### Communication

Communication is the hardest part of running any company. It is important for
everyone to have a clear sense of the company mission and values, how things are
going and what their impact should be.

This is harder in remote-first companies because it requires more effort than
simply talking to someone sitting next to you.

That said, many of the strategies for addressing this will significantly improve
the working environment and culture of any company, remote-first or not. [I’ve
written about this is much more
detail](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/) so
won’t cover it here:

> of running a public company – financials and progress get announced in an
> expected format on an expected timeline. If public companies can do this on a
> quarterly basis, there’s no reason why smaller companies can’t do it too, and
> likely much more regularly.
>
> <cite>[Communication inside startups – what and
> how](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/)</cite>

### Trust

There are industries where trust is not necessary. Those are often environments
where the job is based on rapid, repeat assembly work. Factories or perhaps
certain types of manual labour. In these roles, employees are tracked so closely
to try to engineer trust out of the equation.

That said I’d still argue that regardless of the job, you want to hire people
you can trust otherwise you end up depersonalising the role. That’s not a good
working environment.

The context of this article is knowledge-work such as technology, engineering,
science, research, i.e. roles that could be office-based.

> Employment](https://brainsonfire.com/2015/05/14/i-swear-im-wearing-pants-misconceptions-about-remote-employment/)</cite>

The worst kind of work is where you are simply following orders.

Sometimes issuing specific tasks is necessary e.g. preparing a spreadsheet of
KPIs or fixing a reported bug. However, most knowledge-work is best [driven by
outcomes](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/01/outcome-driven-innovation-product-managers/),
leaving the individual to decide how to achieve it ([guided by the company
mission and
values](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/)).

[Managers should not be defining
“how”](https://davidmytton.blog/product-managers-are-not-responsible-for-how/) and
need to take deliberate steps to avoid being controlling.

![Tweet by @clairejlew](tweet-clairejlew-1113842464157253632.png "[Tweet by @clairejlew](https://twitter.com/clairejlew/status/1113842464157253632)")

Very few knowledge workers bill by time increment. Engineers, programmers and
academics are usually paid fixed salaries.

Lawyers are a good counter-example. Some projects can be scoped to a fixed
budget but legal questions often require research which can’t be time estimated.
Such things require reading, writing, editing and conference calls plus
discussion with colleagues. You are paying for their ability to locate and
synthesise information so as to form a technical, legal opinion.

Another example might be software engineering. There are many freelancers who
will charge based on number of hours. Whether this is the correct way to charge
for development is debatable. The best consultants work with customers on the
basis of the value they deliver, not the amount of time spent.

Understanding whether someone is performing in a salaried role is more
complicated than correlating minutes tracked, lines of code written, emails
sent, bugs fixed, tickets replied to, or whatever arbitrary and irrelevant
metric your manager might be able to come up with.

This is ultimately about working to outcomes and not micromanaging your team.

![Tweet by @clairejlew](tweet-clairejlew-1123980741421834240.png "[Tweet by @clairejlew](https://twitter.com/clairejlew/status/1123980741421834240)")

### Being deliberate

Linked to communication, this means taking extra effort to ensure everyone is in
sync. Symptoms of not doing this properly include:

- Information disseminated by rumour.
- Inaccuracies and mixed messages leading to confusion.
- Incorrect understanding of roles, goals, methods of working and deliverables.
- Not knowing how the company is performing.
- Misunderstanding what everyone is working on and how you should be
  contributing.
- Inability for teams to “do the right thing” and needing to wait for specific
  directions and task assignments.

The most common approach to address this is to write everything down, share
everything, record/transcribe meetings, be as transparent as possible and not
rely on informal methods of communication.

![Tweet by @harjtaggar](tweet-harjtaggar-1111810274212732928.png "[Tweet by @harjtaggar](https://twitter.com/harjtaggar/status/1111810274212732928)")

An engineering driven approach is to think about [how to set up an
organisational commit
log](https://davidmytton.blog/the-organisational-commit-log/).

This is where tools start to come in and becomes crucial for scaling past a
couple of people. Do you use Slack as the primary communication method? Or
email? What goes into a Google Doc vs a text file in a code repo? These are all
important decisions but what you do and how you do it don’t really matter. It’s
making a decision that counts. Everything should have exactly one “correct
place” and everyone should know where that is.

Without formally documenting how the company operates, you end up with multiple
channels and information all over the place. Sharepoint, Google Docs, Slack,
Confluence, email, [other random tool used by just one team].

[GitLab’s handbook offers a great example of how to they
this.](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/) You could adopt the
same approach or create your own. The point is to just make a decision, then
document it.

## How do you motivate a remote team?

There are 3 key elements to motivating remote, distributed teams:

- **Meaningful work:** This is one of the main advantages of smaller startups –
  each person is a significant part of the company and has a large impact on
  overall success. As the organisation grows, roles necessarily become more
  specialised and the meaning of the work changes. In startups, you work on a
  large part of something used by a small number of people. In large
  corporates, you work on a small part of something used by a large number of
  people. [This is
  leverage](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/).
  Otherwise, it can be challenging to see what impact your work has. [Bored
  people quit](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/).
- **Care about your people:** It might sound obvious but so many companies
  clearly do not care about their people. This can still be a competitive
  advantage in how your company culture, values and approach to management
  bring out the best in everyone. This isn’t about providing free lunch,
  unlimited holiday ([which actually doesn’t
  work](https://davidmytton.blog/startup-holiday-policies-unlimited-time-off-doesnt-work/))
  or book allowances, it comes down to the fundamentals of [managing
  humans](https://managinghumans.com/). Do you feel like your manager cares
  about you as a person? Are they regularly making time to talk about not just
  work-related topics? Do you trust them and feel like they have your
  back? [Companies are not
  families](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-company-isnt-a-family/) but they
  are quite close it it. The relationship is always going to be professional
  but it is in the interests of the company not just to care about revenue and
  profit because it is actually the people delivering those numbers. [People
  don’t quit bosses, they quit jobs, but who is responsible for what the job
  is like? The
  boss](https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-people-really-quit-their-jobs).
- **Communicate regularly:** This is a running theme of the post so I won’t add
  any more here other than continuing to highlight how important it is.

Notice how these are not unique to remote, distributed companies? You can apply
them to any company. It is only the implementation that is different in a remote
company.

## Challenges of remote, distributed working

### Personal connections

The most crucial lesson I learned was about how important it was to get to know
the team in-person, and for the team to get to know each other.

Whenever we hired someone new at Server Density, I could separate their time
with the company into two phases: before they met everyone, and after. Although
new hires usually got on with everyone fine via chat and video calls, there was
a noticeable difference in their engagement once they had met the whole company.

Early in the life of my company, full meetups were more ad-hoc and less
frequent. But by the time of the acquisition we were trying to get the whole
company to meet every quarter.

There are many ways to organise these meetups, from flying the whole company
away for exotic retreats to just a few days all working together in one place.
What matters isn’t so much the format but getting everyone together to work,
socialise and get to know each other.

> <cite>[GitLab

This can be expensive, especially as the company grows, but is definitely worth
the cost for the improvements to team morale and productivity in the long run.

Remote, distributed working is not a method of cost-saving. Money not spent on
an office [will instead be spent on travel
expenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdtPNXtkBhE).

[Buffer wrote about how they handle their
meetups](https://open.buffer.com/remote-team-meetups/) and also recorded a more
recent podcast that goes into detail about how it all works.

### Working on a single mission

Sometimes it’s necessary to bring everyone together for a sprint towards a
single goal. Such occasions should be rare but where that shared sense or
purpose is really necessary, it is beneficial to all be in the same physical
location.

If I was starting a new company, I would include significantly more time working
together from the same location. Critical times call for working in-person.The
formation of a new startup is one of those times.

This is one of the arguments behind a tweet by investor, Arianna Simpson:

![Tweet by @ariannasimpson](tweet-ariannasimpson-1106256941922213889.png "[Tweet by @ariannasimpson](https://twitter.com/ariannasimpson/status/1106256941922213889)")

In a followup podcast she elaborated on the specific scenarios where she thinks
it does make sense for everyone to be in the same location.

> One thing I’ve noticed about startups that end up being very successful is
> often there is this strong sense of shared mission and shared energy, and that
> I find very difficult to replicate if you have people in different locations
> because you don’t have the same sense of camaraderie, the same sense of “You
> know what, this sucks but we’re gonna stay here until 10 PM and pound it out
> until we’re done ’cause we’ve gotta get this release out,” or whatever it is.

> <cite>[Is remote work

Starting a new project is a similar situation where you might want to have the
team together for the kick-off, planning, design and initial implementation.

The end of a project can also be a good time to have everyone together.
Celebrating the launch and completion of a major project in person can have a
major, positive impact on morale.

Remote, distributed-first does not mean exclusively remote, distributed-only.

### Communication

You’ll note that communication is a common theme when thinking about remote,
distributed teams. This is because it is so difficult to get right.

If the problem of working in an office is the constant interruptions, then the
problem of remote working is the default to using real time chat. Slack is the
most common example, but it applies to any kind of instant messaging.

I’ve written in detail about the challenges of communication in general and also
about chat:

> I personally dislike Slack (and any real-time chat) for anything other than
> general, social chat or deliberate collaboration on an ongoing project e.g.
> triaging a customer issue with a group of people in real time, doing incident
> response, or backchannel chat between participants during a sales meeting.
> These are all instances where a small number of people come together for a
> specific task and for a specific period of time, after which they disband.
> Real time chat is an awful tool for anything else because it implies everyone
> must be available and responsive immediately, at all times. Information is too
> easily lost.
>
> <cite>[Communication inside startups – what and
> how](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/)</cite>

My favourite article on the challenges of chat is “[Is group chat making you
sweat?](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/)“. Email is
my preferred method of communication because of how flexible it is – I can
choose my client, layout, set up filters and decide when to check it. It’s not
perfect but it really does beat instant messaging:

> So what about IMs? In short… they combine the worst of both worlds while
> having the strength of none of them.
>
> In theory, IMs are supposed to be fast (“instant”), but in practice typing
> takes enough time, to make instant messages much slower than simply talking.
> Ironically, the expectation of a fast response forces everyone to write short
> and rather poorly structured short phrases that are hard to understand,
> especially out of the context of current circumstances.
>
> In theory, IM communication is persistent, but in practice because of lack of
> structure, intertwined topics, and insufficient metadata, what have been
> persisted is mostly useless. Searching through the history of a Slack room is
> difficult, and rarely useful.
>
> <cite>[Kill Instant Messaging](https://dpc.pw/kill-instant-messaging)</cite>

That said, we have gone through a similar transition in the past – from no email
to email – and similar problems arose. Email is certainly not universally loved.

> In a 2011 study published in the journal Organization Science, researchers
> noted that while email was widely regarded as a “growing source of stress in

> nearly a decade earlier, conducted when email itself was still ripping through
> American offices, and producing its own stories of relief, ambivalence, and

As with any workplace culture, it is important for management to set the example
of what is acceptable.

Chat is here to stay and so this means developing a simple set of rules for
where communication should take place. One approach is to delete messages after
a short period of time. This makes it clear that chat is ephemeral. How often do
you actually search chat logs and find something useful?

## Density of expertise

Despite the major advantage of remote, distributed work being that you can hire
the best people anywhere in the world, expertise still clusters in specific
locations.

Whilst you *can* build these teams remotely, it may place you at a disadvantage
against competition who can leverage the benefits of a specific location.

If you are building a high-growth, venture funded startup in a very competitive
industry, this will matter at very specific stages of the company lifecycle. It
matters who the initial founding team are. It matters when you start to build
out that first commercial team. And it matters again when the company goes into
scale mode, leading into an IPO.

Outside of those critical turning points, and for businesses that are operating
on a different growth model, then this matters less.

It will be interesting to [see how GitLab progress towards their Nov 2020 IPO
date](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/04/08/khosla-ventures-gitlab-meeting/) but
despite being an amazing example of how to run a remote, distributed company, it
is interesting that [the CEO is based in San
Francisco](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/04/08/khosla-ventures-gitlab-meeting/).

## Tips and tricks for remote, distributed teams

At Server Density, we developed a number of mechanisms to help run the remote,
distributed team. These evolved over time from 2009 to the acquisition of the
company in 2018.

### Weekly roundup

This started as a weekly standup for the whole company to report on what they
had been doing that week but it eventually changed primarily to be a social
discussion.

Meetings are a necessary part of working with multiple people but using them to
distribute status updates is very inefficient and expensive. Status updates can
be provided in writing, asynchronously. Meetings are for discussion and debate.
But when you have a team all working remotely, regularly getting together to
“see” each other also has a social benefit.

It was also the only compulsory meeting during the week. Unless you were on
holiday, you had to be in this call.

At one point, we stopped the meetings for a few months and experimented with
just using written updates. We quickly had requests to bring back the meetings
so we could talk to each other!

The format we ended with was as follows:

1. **CEO Update (~5 minutes):** Any announcements or important news as well as a
   quick update on the key business metrics, with a more detailed writeup
   shared later. I also highlighted one or two things I’d seen during the week
   that particularly stood out – deals closed, great responses to support
   issues, tricky bugs fixed, etc. The important thing was to mention one or
   two people and some specific piece of work I thought deserved everyone
   knowing about.
2. **Team updates (~1 minute each):** Every person would say something they
   found interesting during the week. Updates could include work as well as
   something they had read or watched. We used a random order generator to mix
   up the order of speakers every week. After each person had finished
   speaking, there was an opportunity to ask questions. This often prompted
   some good discussions.
3. **Anything else:** An opportunity for anyone to mention something not already
   discussed.

With 20 people we were usually able to complete this meeting within 30 minutes.
It breaks some of the rules for meetings e.g. [no status
updates](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/41-skip-the-status-meeting) but we
were deliberate in what the format was about – hearing from your colleagues
about what they had been doing.

This worked nicely for us but I’m not sure how far this would scale. Even being
strict about times, people tend to go over their 1 minute. The format we used
above worked for us at 20 people but is quite different from what we used at 5
and 10 people. [GitLab have blogged about how they changed their weekly
40-person meeting into a 10-15 minute
podcast](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/06/03/how-we-turned-40-person-meeting-into-a-podcast/).

### Random calls with team members

Working with people in an office usually means some socialising outside of work
hours where you get to know your colleagues personally. This is more difficult
for remote, distributed work because “out of hours” should mean disconnecting
completely!

Every week, everyone was paired up for a 30 min call with someone random from
the company. There was no particular agenda so they could discuss what they
liked. Even on a small team, this helped connect team members who might rarely
(or never) talk to each other.

This scales well even with large companies because as the team grows, you become
more siloed in who you interact with on a daily basis.

### What have you been working on?

Knowing what your colleagues are doing is one of the [challenges of
communication](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/) made
more difficult by remote, distributed working. One fix we tried was a regular
prompt for people to answer the question: “what have you been working on [today
| this week | recently]?”

[We used Basecamp to automatically ask this every
day](https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/50-automatic-check-ins) (and also tried
it more infrequently e.g. a couple of times per week). It was never compulsory
and different people wrote at different frequencies to suit them, and when they
had done something worth broadcasting to the whole company. There are Slack bots
available to do this too.

The important thing was that it was voluntary and non-specific. Anyone could
write whatever they liked. Tracking of bugs, epics, tasks, stories and other
precise units of work is for other tools.

This worked for a time but usage declined over time to the point where not
enough people were using it to make it worth continuing. It was replaced by the
weekly roundup (see above).

However, one thing we did find was that there was a weird political element to
“likes” of posts. Feedback I received indicated that there was an almost
addictive aspect of checking posts for likes, seeing who had liked them and
whether your own post had more likes than others.

Not having to think about likes having ditched Facebook and Instagram is a nice
side benefit I’ve noticed. It definitely influences your behaviour in negative
ways. [Basecamp discovered this themselves, replacing the feature with
Boosts](https://m.signalvnoise.com/introducing-boosts-an-all-new-way-to-show-your-support-in-basecamp/).
A good move.

## Final thoughts

There is no “one true way” of running a company that will automatically deliver
total productivity in every situation. Whether you run entirely in an office,
entirely remotely or a mixture of both, every organisation needs properly
thought through processes.

Those processes will differ as the company grows. Smaller organisations need
minimal overhead to remain agile and able to iterate quickly. Larger firms need
to be able to coordinate multiple teams working on various projects. But no
process at all is just as much a decision about working practices (probably in
an environment of chaos) as writing a detailed handbook would be.

The challenge of remote working is that it needs a much more deliberate approach
to running things. There are fewer organisations using remote, distributed
working methods. Not as much shared knowledge exists. But that is changing.

Companies that do not allow remote and/or do not properly consider how to
effectively incorporate remote working into the long-term are going to fall
behind and fail to attract the talented people that are crucial to success. The
form that takes will be different in every case so it is important to avoid
“remote purism”. It is clear when things aren’t working but there are many ways
to make it work well.
