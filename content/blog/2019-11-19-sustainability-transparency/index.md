Do you know what your current carbon footprint is? If not, how would you go
about calculating it? What information do you need?

When you’re grocery shopping, do you know the environmental impact of the
products you’re buying? You probably know that meat and diary both have high
greenhouse gas emission and land use impacts in general, but how would you
compare with alternatives? [Should you buy lamb from the UK or New
Zealand?](https://hdl.handle.net/10182/125) [Should you pick oat, soy or almond
milk instead?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46654042) [Are you
optimising for carbon emissions or nutritional
content?](https://doi.org/10.3402/fnr.v58.20687)

The problem is that whilst all products have detailed information about their
ingredients and nutritional values, the environmental impact of your purchasing
decisions is unknown. It is also unknowable. Whether it is carbon emissions,
water usage or energy inputs, it is impossible to know the environmental impact
of food because the information is not reported.

This not unique to food – very few products provide sufficient information to be
able to make accurate environmental assessments. Some industries have adopted
voluntary environmental certification standards, such as the [RSPO standard for
sustainable palm oil](https://rspo.org/certification) or the [FSC certification
for paper](https://www.fsc.org/en), but they are the minority. Broader schemes
like [Fair Trade](https://www.fairtrade.net/standard) are also useful because
they incorporate not just environmental standards but are known for their
ethical credentials. But very few products are covered.

Company level reporting is starting to be adopted. Amazon was recently forced to
release [its 2018 carbon
footprint](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/carbon-footprint) after 9000
employees wrote an open letter criticising the lack of transparency:

> We, the undersigned 8,695 Amazon employees, ask that you adopt the climate
> plan shareholder resolution and release a company-wide climate plan that
> incorporates the principles outlined in this letter.

[Reporting standards for
sustainability](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards) exist and there are
voluntary schemes, such as [CDP](https://www.cdp.net/), for companies to submit
environmental data in a standardised format. However, not every company
participates
– [Amazon](https://www.cdp.net/en/responses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&queries%5Bname%5D=amazon) does
not,
but [Google](https://www.cdp.net/en/responses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&queries%5Bname%5D=google) and [Microsoft](https://www.cdp.net/en/responses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&queries%5Bname%5D=microsoft) do.

Indeed, some technology companies are leading in how they approach environmental
reporting. Apple is a good example of publishing detailed environmental reports
as well as issuing report cards for every one of its products ([at the bottom of
the environmental page](https://www.apple.com/environment/)). Microsoft [does
the same for its Surface
products](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55974) (although
it is not up to date with the latest 2019 line-up).

The [consumer demand is
there](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2018/was-2018-the-year-of-the-influential-sustainable-consumer/) for
“sustainable” products but it is currently too complex for most consumers to
figure out what they should actually buy.

Unfortunately it hasn’t changed much since that study was published to 2016. New
companies and [startups can build environmental reporting into their
culture](https://davidmytton.blog/how-startups-can-help-combat-climate-change/) but
established organisations need to put in more effort.

Supply chains are complex and it’s not just one company that needs to report –
every element of the chain must do so. However, gathering and releasing data is
crucial and the larger the company is, the more leverage they have over their
suppliers.

We know food labelling works ([especially if it is
simple](https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12364)) but the information needs to be
available. The format – whether traffic light colours on packages or detailed
numerical reporting – will be determined by who the audience is, but companies
should publish all the data they have.

We already have financial reporting requirements because without them investors
cannot make informed decisions. In the UK, reporting on greenhouse gas emissions
has been [required by all quoted companies since 2013, and reporting of global
energy use since
2019](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/measuring-and-reporting-environmental-impacts-guidance-for-businesses).
However, these are limited because they are published in aggregate. Any company
that comes under the reporting requirements is likely to have more than a single
product. Without the granular product level data, it isn’t particularly useful
for external observers.

This might seem like overly heavy government regulation but reporting can easily
be abbreviated for smaller organisations ([just as financial statements
are](https://www.gov.uk/annual-accounts/microentities-small-and-dormant-companies)).
It is better for government to force disclosure of information and then have the
market develop its own approaches to analysing and comparing product options
rather than having the government force product specific directives on
companies. This is becoming easier with tools such as [Salesforce’s
Sustainability
Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/stories/2019/09/091819-wk/) and
new startups such as [Emitwise](https://www.emitwise.com/). Change voluntarily
or have changed forced upon you.

Why can’t environmental impact be like the price mechanism in a properly
competitive market?
