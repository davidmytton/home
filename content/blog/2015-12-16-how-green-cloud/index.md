With the recent climate talks in Paris, energy consumption is a pressing topic.
Unsurprisingly, [cloud vendors have
touted](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloud-computing-server-utilization-the-environment/) their
infrastructure at scale as a way to reduce IT's carbon footprint due to the
efficiencies gained from running such huge deployments.

That doesn't change the reality that [data centers remain a large source of
carbon
emissions](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/) through
their intense energy and cooling requirements. So when it comes to energy usage
and renewables, how do the cloud providers stack up?

## Amazon Web Services

AWS has committed to 100 percent renewable energy, but has not offered a date by
when it plans to achieve that. As of December 2015, the energy mix across AWS is
25 percent renewable with a plan to reach 40 percent by the end of 2016. This
will come from some newly announced generation facilities: wind farms in Fowler
Ridge (online in Jan 2016), U.S. East (Dec 2016), and U.S. West (May 2017) --
plus a solar facility in the U.S. East due online in October 2016.

Amazon participates in a number of programs, including [Buyer's
Principles](http://buyersprinciples.org/)to help increase purchasing power for
low-carbon energy sources (which also includes Microsoft and Google) and
the [American Council on Renewable Energy](http://www.acore.org/).

If you want to be green on AWS now, you have two public regions to choose from
that are 100 percent carbon neutral: U.S. West (Oregon) and Frankfurt. AWS's
GovCloud region is also carbon neutral.

## Google Cloud Platform

Google has been carbon neutral since 2007 and now sources its energy from 37
percent renewables, [following announcements this
month](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/google-buys-enough-clean-energy-to-power-two-san-franciscos/) to
buy another 842 megawatts of renewable energy. It [plans to triple its renewable
energy
purchases](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/27/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-climate-pledge) by
2025 on the road to 100 percent renewables (also, no date).

[Google purchases green
energy](http://www.google.com/green/energy/use/) directly from on-site renewable
facilities but also uses power purchase agreements to pipe renewable energy into
the public grid, which it then consumes. It also [has a $2.5 billion
fund](http://www.google.com/green/energy/investments/) for investment into
renewable energy projects and companies.

## IBM/Softlayer

IBM has pledged support of the American Business Act on Climate, but offers
limited information about what it actually achieves, at least compared to the
relatively detailed stats provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. IBM has
pledged to be using 20 percent renewables by 2020 and reduce energy consumption
by 35 percent by 2020 (against 2005 as the base year, adjusted for acquisitions
and divestitures). It offers only a basic figure of 14 percent renewable
electricity in 2014, with an additional 5 percent of energy consumed from the
general power grid from renewables.

In a statement, IBM explained that three of its SoftLayer data centers (one in
Houston and two in Dallas) use 100 percent wind energy and that the company has
been increasing its renewable energy usage since 2001. Given that it has only
reached 14 percent in 15 years, this is quite slow progress. It fits with IBM's
commitment to adopt renewables "where it makes business sense" as opposed to
pushing for improvements in green energy efficiency and investing to help
improve technologies (and hence drive down prices) in the same way its
competitors are doing.

[IBM has a detailed environmental
report](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/annual/IBMEnvReport_2014.pdf) (the
latest version is from 2014) that goes into detail about its various renewables
projects, programs, and investments (e.g., wind and biomass in Ireland, plus
on-site solar in Zurich, New Delhi, and Massachusetts) but it's difficult to
separate the actual detail in relation to SoftLayer and IBM Cloud. IBM
specifically states that the majority of its data centers are 10 to 30 years old
and improving efficiency requires "thoughtful planning."

## Microsoft Azure

Microsoft does not have a fancy Web page that touts its green efforts, instead
publishing an annual [Citizenship
Report](http://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/transparencyhub/citizenship-reporting/) to
deliver the stats. This report states that Microsoft has been carbon neutral
since July 1, 2012, including all of its offices, business flights, and data
center operations. According to the 2015 report, this is achieved through 91
percent renewables (the majority is wind, but also biomass, hydro, landfill gas,
and on-site solar) compared to 47 percent renewables in 2014.

Microsoft's report goes into significant detail about emissions, including
breakdowns of where emissions are coming from as well as other areas of interest
around environmental sustainability, such as water use and responsible sourcing.

Microsoft was [also among 13 companies pledging
action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/27/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-climate-pledge) with
the U.S. government on climate change this summer.

## Cloud carbon footprints compared

| Company       | Carbon neutral?            | Power from renewables                                 | 100 percent renewable commitment |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Amazon        | No (but 2 AWS regions are) | 25 percent now, 40 percent by end 2016                | Yes, but no date                 |
| Google        | Yes (2007)                 | 37 percent                                            | Yes, but no date                 |
| IBM/Softlayer | No                         | 14 percent but unclear if this is IBM Cloud/Softlayer | No                               |
| Microsoft     | Yes (2012)                 | 91 percent                                            | Yes, but no date                 |

## Going green in the cloud

The big three -- Amazon, Google and Microsoft -- have all committed to 100
percent renewables and are on their way towards that. Microsoft is almost there
(91 percent) as of 2015, with Amazon in third place (25 percent), although with
significant investments due to come online over the next year.

IBM/Softlayer is the disappointment here. The company has a large legacy
footprint to deal with and really only entered the cloud game with its
acquisition of SoftLayer, but a commitment to 20 percent renewables by 2020
seems lackluster nonetheless.

Although Apple is not a public cloud provider, the company is worth a mention,
because [all of its data centers are powered by 100 percent locally generated
renewables](http://www.apple.com/environment/) -- and cloud services like iCloud
and iTunes are covered.

There are many advantages to moving to a public cloud provider, but few
customers factor in providers' investments in green facilities. They should.
Just as you can benefit from price drops without doing anything, by moving
workloads to the public cloud, you can enjoy efficiency and environmental
improvements as part of the deal. If you're on the fence about which provider to
choose, consider the commitment to green energy.
