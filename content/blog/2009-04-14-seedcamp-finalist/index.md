We are pleased to have been [chosen as a top 20
finalist](http://blog.seedcamp.com/2009/04/top-20-teams-for-mini-seedcamp-london.html) from
over 100 startups from Europe to attend [Mini Seedcamp London
2009](http://seedcamp.com/pages/london09).

Mini Seedcamp is a [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) style one day
event that is running on Monday (20th April):

> Mini Seedcamp London will be bringing together 20 of the best seed stage web
> tech startups with experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and developers from
> the UK and all over Europe to participate in a day of intense mentoring, panel
> discussions and presentations. The day consists of; 5 minute presentations by
> the teams; a panel discussion; and four 1:1 mentoring sessions.

Although Boxed Ice is not seeking funding, I will be attending this 1 day event
next week representing the company with the aim to promote our first
product, [Server Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), to potential
customers and other tech startups.
