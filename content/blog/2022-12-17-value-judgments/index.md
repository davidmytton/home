I often see people making value judgements when discussing sustainable
computing. This puts a higher value on one type of computer use versus another.
The implication is that we should do less of some things because their value
cannot justify the environmental impact.

These judgments are [commonly expressed in terms of
waste](/dirty-data-carbon-footprint-of-photo-storage/): duplicate photos are a
waste, social media is a waste, "hoarding" data is a waste. The analogy is
between bits and atoms where the atoms (in the form of physical objects) take up
space that could be used for something else (supposedly better), or are
discarded and cause disposal or recycling problems.

This analogy fails because it misrepresents the fundamental innovation of
digital services: zero marginal cost and abundance. Bits and atoms are not the
same. At the scale of the internet, storing additional data does not deprive
someone else of their ability to store data. Streaming video at 4k does not
prevent someone else from also streaming video at 4k. This is completely
different from the physical world where there are real limits and space is truly
"used up".

Another analogy is with harmful or addictive substances, like alcohol. This is
the idea that we’re “drunk” on computing resources like cloud storage or data,
and we must adopt the idea of “[digital
sobriety](https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/lean-ict-our-new-report/)”.
[One supposed solution](https://doi.org/10.21428/bf6fb269.7625cc76) is an
“internet speed limit” to stop wasteful behavior. This is often used in the
context of data center or network energy, particularly when data centers are
competing for physical resources like water.

These arbitrary rules are applied by people who feel like they have the right to
judge the behavior of others. How the rules should be define are ambigious, or
are a rehashed [argument from
authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority). They distract
from the real challenges of building sustainable infrastructure by focusing on
inconsequential actions like deleting unwanted photos or reducing video
streaming quality settings. These are [meaningless
interventions](https://doi.org/10.1177/1469540517717782) that confer a false
sense of “making a difference” that could be better directed elsewhere. Or
worse, [exacerbate the problem](/standardizing-carbon-accounting/).

Effort is better directed at altering systems so that everyone can benefit from
improvements at scale. This means working towards greater deployment of clean
energy systems that power our IT. It means increasing transparency to help
analyze the energy consumption of cloud computing, so we can understand the
energy (and carbon, water, materials..) footprint of services built on top.

The goal of [sustainable computing](/sustainable-computing/) is to be able to
use more and more IT services whilst reducing the environmental impact. This
means providing data, tools, dashboards, and best practices for those developing
and operating the systems we use every day. It's
[already](/paper-notes-jupiter-evolving-transforming-googles-datacenter-network/)
happening in
[networking](/approaches-to-calculating-network-website-energy-and-carbon/) with
data transfer volumes vastly increasing at the same time as energy consumption
decreases.

Puritan value judgments don’t help and any analysis based on them should be
rejected.
