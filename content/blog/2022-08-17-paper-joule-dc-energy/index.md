The scientific journal, [Joule](https://www.cell.com/joule/home), has published
a paper I’ve co-authored reviewing data center energy estimates between
2007-2021: [Sources of data center energy estimates: A comprehensive
review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.07.011)

## Summary

Data centers are a critical component of information technology (IT), providing
an environment for running computer equipment. Reliance on data centers for
everyday activities has brought increased scrutiny of their energy footprint,
yet the literature presents a wide range of estimates with
challenging-to-validate calculations that make it difficult to rely on their
subsequent estimates. In this review, we analyze 258 data center energy
estimates from 46 original publications between 2007 and 2021 to assess their
reliability by examining the 676 sources used. We show that 31% of sources were
from peer-reviewed publications, 38% were from non-peer-reviewed reports, and
many lacked clear methodologies and data provenance. We also highlight issues
with source availability—there is a reliance on private data from IDC (43%) and
Cisco (30%), 11% of sources had broken web links, and 10% were cited with
insufficient detail to locate. We make recommendations to 3 groups of
stakeholders on how to improve and better understand the literature—end users
who make use of data center energy estimates (e.g., journalists), the research
community (e.g., academics), and policy makers or regulators within the energy
sector (e.g., grid operators).
