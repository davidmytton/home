This is my response to the UK Home Office consultation on the Draft
Investigatory Powers (Technical Capability) Regulations 2017, [published
online](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/ourwork/reports/home-office-consultation:-investigatory-powers-%28technical-capability%29-regulations-2017).

[The draft
regulations](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/assets/files/pdfs/home_office/ANNEX_A_Draft_Investigatory_Powers_%28Technical%20Capability%29_Regulations.pdf) imply
that, once passed, there will be a legal requirement for communication providers
to build backdoors into encrypted or otherwise secured systems so that the
security services can access messages in real time. This will apply to any
service with more than 10,000 users.

The idea of having a “golden key”, “master key”, “key escrow” or some other
system which allows authorized governmental access to the system has many
problems including how to secure the key, how to distribute the key to those who
are authorized and how to prevent independent security researchers from
discovering the key.

You have no doubt already received responses explaining why this is a bad idea
from a technical perspective so I won’t go into that in my response. I urge you
to read resources such as: <https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/97690> and
<https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/04/16/how-do-we-build-encryption-backdors/>
which explain the technicalities of why we should not build backdoors. Instead,
I will comment as the co-founder and CEO of a small software business based in
London.

My business develops software that is deployed into a wide range of enterprise
IT environments for customers around the world. We put a lot of effort into
securing our infrastructure and ensuring that we follow best practices for
developing secure software. This includes the use of encrypted transport for the
server performance data we collect, as well as encrypting user data such as
passwords and other login tokens.

We are solving challenging technical problems with large volumes of data and
high performance systems, which means we need to be able to recruit the best
technical talent we possibly can. With regular involvement in the community
through conferences and writing articles, we have built up a reputation as a
good place to work that allows engineers to work on interesting problems,
achieving their best work.

The UK and London in particular is highly regarded for its fintech startups. We
are leading the way in well thought through banking regulation and allowing new
financial products to be brought to market by innovative startups. As with my
own company, these startups want to be able to access the best talent. Indeed,
in recent days we have seen foreign businesses making major investments
in [London](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-09/canadian-fund-with-6-billion-war-chest-picks-london-for-eu-hub), [Cambridge
and Edinburgh](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35379861) due to the
availability of talent and capital.

If these regulations force UK businesses to build backdoors into their software,
against the advice of security experts, this will be considered by engineers to
be building flawed software. Why would the top engineers want to be hampered by
such legislation, and be associated with the damaged reputation of building
insecure software? With a large market for engineers worldwide, especially with
remote working (something my company uses to be able to find the best engineers,
wherever they are), the best engineers will simply choose to work for non-UK
companies.

Not only that, but these regulations apply only within the jurisdiction of the
UK. Whilst it might be possible to force the major corporate owners of WhatsApp
(Facebook) or iMessage (Apple) to reduce the security of their systems, there
are so many alternative products that this simply causes those targeted to move
to different messaging platforms. Why would any startup locate itself in the UK
if it knew that should its product become successful i.e. Once it hit 10,000
users, it would then be required to implement a backdoor?

Given the cyber-skills shortage with the UK having the second largest cyber
skills gap of 10 major countries ([PN 554 page 4: “Skills
Shortage”](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-0554/POST-PN-0554.pdf)),
does the government really want to introduce barriers to attracting and
retaining the best talent?

## Conclusion

Ultimately, I believe the technical barriers are sufficient to make these
regulations useless. [Anyone can use encryption because it’s just
maths](https://youtu.be/3G8dPAdmyss). There are many free and open source
communication services which users will just move to. And the business impact
will negatively affect the UKs ability to address concerns with cyber
security, [just when it is most
needed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39899646).
