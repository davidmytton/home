_[Originally published on the Console
blog](https://blog.console.dev/devtools-startups-standing-out-to-investors/).
I’m actively angel investing in devtools startups, so if you’re building
something where developers are the primary user, [please get in
touch](https://console.dev/zero/)._

There is a high quality bar for devtools today. Design and UX are
important. [Developers like the
CLI](https://blog.console.dev/cli-first-devtools/), but the consumerization of
devtools is happening quickly. The late 2000s was the era of the slick mobile
app. This design focus moved to SaaS in the early 2010s and has now arrived in
devtools.

Think of some of the standard tools a developer uses today: GitHub. Vercel.
Warp. Supabase. Tailscale. All of them have incredibly smooth onboarding,
up-to-date documentation, dark mode, clean yet flashy marketing websites that
demo the product well (neon is currently cool), a regularly updated blog, public
changelogs…there’s always room for improvement, but these are the table stakes.
The full experience stands out, particularly when I come across a new tool for
the first time.

A focus on the details from end to end is a good indicator of success. Too often
there are documentation inconsistencies, certain steps don’t work, images don’t
match, or the onboarding flow gets interrupted with an error. Scenarios like
using a password manager or having ad blockers enabled are considered edge cases
when [they are actually the norm for most
developers](https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-adblockers-missing-data).
These are signs of lack of attention to detail.

[I’m actively angel investing](https://console.dev/zero/) into startups where
developers are the primary user, and the same applies to deciding when to
invest. All of the good pitches I’ve seen over the past year have stood out
through design and experience. There is [a standard pitch deck
format](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/2u-how-to-build-your-seed-round-pitch-deck),
but the best decks bring in their own colors, fonts, and graphics –
basically [the beginnings of a
brand](https://blog.console.dev/how-to-build-a-brand-for-developers/). Many have
screenshots of a prototype product, sometimes already in production, especially
if there are thousands of GitHub stars behind it.

This all comes together in the pitch meeting, which is in itself another part of
the product and all about [telling a
story](https://www.slideshare.net/ommalik/how-to-tell-your-story-a-simple-framework-for-startups-188319803) to
describe a very optimistic future even when there might not be anything to show
yet. It’s easy to tell apart the founders who have practiced how they want the
meeting to go. They know the common objections, how to differentiate what
they’re building, they know what they want from investors and have questions to
ask.

For my part, when I’m talking with a startup founder about a possible investment
I’m trying to find out a few things:

1. **Who is in the founding team?** There must be at least one technical
   founder who is probably doing most of the initial development. If
   development is being outsourced then I’m not interested. It probably
   shouldn’t be a one-person show, though. All of the co-founders are important
   because building the product is only 50% of the work – the commercialization
   needs as much time as engineering, which is why I also like to see someone
   focusing on that full time. Have they been in a similar space before? Are
   they repeat founders? Have they been the user and/or the customer? What is
   their insight and why are they passionate about spending the next 10 years
   on this?
2. **Is this venture scale?** There are many ways to build a business, but for
   it to work as an investment it has to reach a certain scale. The actual
   route always changes as things progress, but I think about how this can get
   to $100m in revenue in 5-8 years? How does it IPO at a >$1-5bn valuation?
   Not all businesses need investor
   money. [Console](https://console.dev/) itself is bootstrapped and run as a
   profitable business, but if you’re taking investor money then it must be
   venture scale.
3. **Is now the right time?** There are no new ideas and first doesn’t always
   win. Why is the market right, today? How is it different from the
   competition?
4. **Is the user a developer? Is the customer an organization?** It is still
   true that developers rarely pay for anything, but their employer will. So
   will developers use it? Will their company pay for it? What value does it
   bring for the organization? If it’s open source, what is the route to
   monetization (hint: cloud, not support/services).
5. **Is it starting too big?** Everyone wants to be [the new developer platform
   like Heroku](https://christine.website/blog/heroku-devex-2022-05-12), but
   that is very difficult. The big 3 cloud vendors can compete on the biggest,
   broadest portfolio of products. The startup opportunity is in [unbundling a
   small piece and doing a much better
   job](https://blog.console.dev/unbundling-the-cloud/), then expanding over
   time. Trying to replace everything at once is too much.
6. **Does this fit in the developer flow?** The product must fit in the flow of
   something important – mission critical or recurring. If it sits on the side
   e.g. cost saving, then it’s less valuable.
7. **Is it sticky?** There are so many (new) devtools. Is it too easy to switch
   out? Why would developers continue using this for a long time?

There is a limit to how much can be known about pre-seed or seed companies, and
how much time can be spent, but standing out as a potential investment is
similar to standing out as a good product. A good product can be brought down by
lack of good design. Conversely, a nicely illustrated deck is insufficient if
the ideas behind it don’t stack up. But those that manage to combine the two
really stand out.
