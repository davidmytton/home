_Originally [published on the Server Density
blog](https://blog.serverdensity.com/server-density/)._

We have just pushed live the website for our first product, [Server
Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/). This is a server monitoring
application that reports statistics using a small, lightweight Python agent that
is installed on your servers. The website features a short, 2 minute demo video
along with screenshots and details about the product.

We are currently in private, invite only beta but if you’re interested,
e-mail [customer.service@boxedice.com](mailto:customer.service@boxedice.com).
