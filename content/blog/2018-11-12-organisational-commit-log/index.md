As a company grows, I’ve found communication to be the most difficult challenge.
Whether it is explaining the company vision to new hires or finding the
reasoning behind a decision made 6 months ago, recording knowledge and keeping
it up to date requires a lot of effort.

When everyone is in the same office, informal chats are the norm. Even if
everyone is remote, a small team can be in almost-perfect sync with simple one
to one chats or a basic chat room. But problems occur as more people join the
team.

- Who is working on what? Who might be able to help with current challenges or
  problems and what experience and knowledge can be shared?
- What tools, systems, processes and technologies are being considered,
  implemented or used? Is there relevant experience elsewhere in the company
  that can help?
- What decisions have been made about products, customer issues, sales
  pitches, technical approaches? And why?

Just as a code commit log shows the reasons behind a specific change, where is
the organisational commit log?

Email has the advantage of being asynchronous, user customisable (your own
clients, filters, etc) and easily searchable, but [it shouldn’t be a database
for important
information](https://davidmytton.blog/email-is-not-a-good-database/) and is only
useful for the participants of written discussions. Mailing lists could address
that and are well understood particularly for open source projects. [Stripe has
successfully used email](https://stripe.com/blog/email-transparency) with
internal mailing lists to improve transparency but [have had to made adjustments
as they scaled](https://stripe.com/blog/scaling-email-transparency).

Group chat is a good way to communicate with individuals or small groups
but [has a lot of major issues, particularly with
interruptions](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d),
and requires everyone to pay attention to every message and [decide if it’s
relevant to
them](https://abe-winter.github.io/plea's/help/2018/02/11/slack.html).

Unlike email which has subjects and forced threading, chat tends to be more of a
stream, very often with multiple discussions interleaved into the same chat. If
you have teams in multiple timezones, it’s very easy to wake up to hundreds of
messages across many different subjects (because people don’t actually use Slack
threads!) which may or may not be relevant. I like the ability to pipe messages
from other system so there’s only 1 place to catch up e.g. Zendesk tickets, but
it doesn’t seem like a sustainable way to manage a large organisation.

Meetings are another place for knowledge to become lost. Unless you have a
disciplined approach to note taking, recording decisions and the reasons behind
them is easy to neglect. We’re starting to see some “AI” driven attempts to
solve this, [particularly with the Microsoft Teams Meeting Transcription
product](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/cloud-recording).
Having meetings transcribed means that discussion now becomes searchable and can
be referenced in commits, designs, comments and other documentation.

Documentation itself has to become a core part of how a company operates.
Something like [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), a
central wiki that everyone has access to, is more efficient than having
thousands of individual documents in various cloud storage systems. I find the
daily summary of changes of
the [StackPath](https://www.stackpath.com/) confluence a valuable way to
passively see what other teams are doing. But it’s only really effective if
every team is deliberate in writing everything up and keeping it up to date.

Wasn’t this supposed to be a problem that was solved by the [Google Search
Appliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search_Appliance)? And
then [Google Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Desktop). And Google
Drive. And now [Google Cloud
Search](https://gsuite.google.com/products/cloud-search/).

These are all things which tend to only become an issue as a company grows, by
which time it’s almost too late to have writing organisational history be part
of the culture. Forcing everyone into the mindset later on is difficult, which
is probably why communication remains the biggest challenge every organisation
faces.
