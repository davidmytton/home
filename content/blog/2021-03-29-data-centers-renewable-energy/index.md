Transitioning to renewable energy use is an important, but not easily achieved,
goal. Although the past decade has seen significant improvements in IT energy
efficiency, there are indications that this may not continue. Moore’s Law may be
slowing, more people are coming online, and internet traffic is growing faster
than ever before. As energy consumption increases, data center operators will
need to transition to 100% renewable energy use 100% of the time.

Uptime Institute has [recently published
my report](https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/renewable-energy-for-data-centers) covering
the key components of renewable energy sustainability strategies for data
centers. The tech industry has made considerable effort to improve energy
efficiency and is the largest purchaser of renewable energy. Even so, most data
center sustainability strategies still focus on renewable energy certificates
(RECs). RECs are now considered to be low quality products because they cannot
credibly be used to back claims of 100% renewable energy use.

To avoid accusations of greenwashing, data center operators must consider
investing in a portfolio of renewable energy products. RECs may play a part, but
power purchase agreements (PPAs) are becoming more popular, even though there
can be financial risks involved.

A stepwise approach will ease the process. There are four steps that data center
operators need to take on the journey toward the use of sustainable, renewable
energy.

## 1. Measure, report, offset

Electricity is just one component of the carbon footprint of an organization,
but it is relatively easy to measure because exact consumption is regularly
reported for billing purposes. Tracking how much electricity comes from
renewable and nonrenewable sources allows decisions to be made about offsets and
renewables matching. This breakdown can be obtained from the electricity
supplier, or grid-level emissions factors can be used. For example, in the US
this is published annually by state by the [Energy Information
Administration](https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/ghg-emission-factors-hub);
other countries provide similar resources. (A more formal methodology is
explained in the [Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2
guidance](https://ghgprotocol.org/scope_2_guidance).)

Once total emissions are known (that is, total emissions from electricity ― the
full organizational emissions also need to be calculated), the next step is to
buy offset products to mitigate the existing impact. However, there are
significant challenges with [ensuring offset
quality](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/carbon-offset-programs/voluntary-offset-programs/),
and so offsetting is only a stopgap measure. Ideally, offsets must be reserved
for emissions that cannot be reduced by other measures (e.g., by switching to
100% renewable energy).

Measurement and reporting are crucial to understanding carbon footprint and are
effectively becoming a necessary function of doing business. The reporting of
carbon emissions is becoming a legal requirement for larger companies in some
jurisdictions (e.g., the UK). Some companies are starting to require carbon
reporting for their suppliers (for example, Apple and Microsoft, because of
their own goals to be carbon-neutral/negative by 2030).

Data center operators who are not already tracking carbon emissions associated
with electricity purchases may have to invest significant resources to catch up
should reporting become required.

## 2. 100% renewables matching

Ideally, all electricity used should be 100% matched by renewable energy
production. So far in the data center industry, 100% renewables matching has
generally been achieved through purchasing RECs, but PPAs (direct, financial, or
through green supply arrangements) must now take over as the dominant approach.
RECs can act as a stopgap between taking no action and using tools such as PPAs,
but they should eventually be a small component in the overall data center
sustainability strategy.

## 3. Power purchase agreements

Purchasing RECs is a reasonable first step in a sustainability strategy but is
insufficient on its own. Establishing direct/physical PPAs with a nearby
renewable energy generator, combined with their associated RECs, is the gold
standard necessary to truly claim 100% renewable energy use. However, even this
does not mean 100% renewable energy is actually being used by the data center,
just that an amount of purchased renewable energy equivalent to the data
center’s energy use was added to the grid. Virtual/financial PPAs are an option
where the power market does not allow direct retail PPAs.

Both types of PPA involve pricing risk or can act as a hedge against wholesale
price changes. For direct PPAs, the fixed price provides certainty — but if
wholesale prices fall, buyers may be stuck in a long-term contract paying more
than the current market price. Virtual/financial PPAs introduce further
complexity and financial risk: if the wholesale price falls below the
agreed-upon strike price at the time of purchase, the buyer must pay the
supplier the difference, which may be significant.

Despite these risks, the use of PPAs is growing rapidly in the US, particularly
in the tech and communications sectors. Operators with advanced sustainability
programs have been buying PPAs for several years, either directly through
financial/virtual PPAs, or by using green supply agreements through a utility.
My report covers these options in more detail.

## 4. 24/7 renewable energy use

Most matching (of renewable energy purchased against energy actually used)
happens on an annual basis but shifts in generation (the grid mix) happen at a
much lower granularity. There are strategies to smooth this out: different
sources of renewable energy can be combined to create blended PPAs, such as
combining wind and solar energy production with storage capacity. This is useful
because different sources generate at different times (for example, wind can
generate energy at night when solar energy is unavailable).

In 2019, [Microsoft and Vattenfall announced a new
product](https://group.vattenfall.com/press-and-media/pressreleases/2019/vattenfall-and-microsoft-pilot-worlds-first-h-ourly-matching-247-of-renewable-energy) to
provide hourly renewables matching. The pilot started at Microsoft’s Sweden
headquarters and will provide hourly matching to a [new Azure cloud region in
2021](https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2020/11/24/microsoft-announces-investments-to-accelerate-swedens-digital-transformation-and-plans-to-open-its-sustainable-datacenter-region-in-2021/).
No data center operator has achieved 24/7 matching for its entire global fleet,
although some are almost there for individual sites (e.g., in 2019, [Google
achieved](https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/247-carbon-free-energy.pdf) 96%
renewable energy use in Oklahoma [US], and 61% on an hourly basis globally).

This is the objective: 24/7 renewable energy use, 100% of the time. Matching on
an annual basis is not enough to reach the goal of decarbonizing the electricity
grid. All demand ― 100% ― must be supplied by 100% renewable energy, 100% of the
time. This will, of course, take many decades to achieve in most economies.
