Apple are always used as the example of why design is a crucial differentiator.
Having a well designed, easy to use product is regularly cited as why something
is better than a competitor.

That was true in 2007 when comparing the iPhone to other phones.

It was true in 2010-2012 when comparing SaaS products to their on-prem,
enterprise alternatives.

It's not true today.

Having a well designed interface with consistent styling and a well thought
through user experience is standard.

Consumer products are always a few years ahead of business products but even
with SaaS products in 2018, poorly designed products only stand out because
they're now so rare.

It's certainly not that creating good design is easy to do - it's still just as
hard as it always was. It's just that customer expectations have changed in the
same way that everyone expects "mobile" to include iOS and Android, websites
have to work on all major browsers and public cloud infrastructure is the
default.

If you find yourself focusing on your product being "beautiful", "easy to use",
"design led" or leading with "look and feel", you may need to rethink your
competitive positioning.
