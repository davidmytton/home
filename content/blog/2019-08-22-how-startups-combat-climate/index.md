Startup founders have a lot of competing priorities: creating a great product,
building the company culture, closing initial sales, hiring an effective team
and fund raising.

When I was [starting and growing my company, Server
Density](https://davidmytton.blog/about/), the last thing I wanted was yet
another thing to think about. Indeed, one of the [lessons I
learned](https://davidmytton.blog/3-lessons-from-9-years-of-startups/) during
that time was that I should have brought on more experienced people to take over
core areas sooner.

But just like [designing hiring processes to encourage
diversity](https://davidmytton.blog/how-to-hire-engineers-sourcing-candidates/),
thinking about [deliberate
communication](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/) and [basic
security
practices](https://davidmytton.blog/cyber-security-leaving-the-door-unlocked/),
if you don’t consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of
your company, you are building up debt that might never be repaid. Not just
within the company, but globally. Climate change really is an existential
problem.

Think about it as you would building a house. Is it easier to consider the
materials, appliances, design and architecture up-front or to try and retrofit
and replace items once the house has been built?

It is much better to start a company that includes thinking about its impact on
the environment from the beginning than it is to change existing systems in the
future. Companies formed decades ago have some excuse about why it’s taking them
time to change, but companies formed today do not.

## Decisions by startups today compound into the future

There are also many more startups and small businesses than there are
corporates. [In the UK, there were 5.7 million private sector
businesses](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/746599/OFFICIAL_SENSITIVE_-_BPE_2018_-_statistical_release_FINAL_FINAL.pdf) at
the start of 2018:

- 99.3% (5.6 million) were small businesses with 0-49 employees.
- 0.6% (35,000) were medium-sized with 50-249 employees.
- 0.1% (7,500) were large businesses with 250+ employees.

75% of the total business population did not employee anyone aside from the
owner(s). The advantage of small businesses and startups is the flexibility –
that’s how they rapidly develop innovative ideas, including how the business
operates.

Convincing a large corporate to make changes such as becoming carbon neutral has
a much larger individual impact when it is achieved, but their size also makes
it much harder to do. There are vested interests, existing infrastructure, long
contracts and “business as usual” inertia. Startups and small businesses are
able to make changes quickly, which is why they are so good at disruptive
innovation.

Startups are also the future growth companies. If the company starts with a
sustainability mindset, it’s much easier to continue with that approach as the
new status quo, rather than try and change it in the future.

The best way to make a difference today is through market forces. By introducing
sustainability as a key part of the buying criteria, larger companies will be
forced to consider it. Although a single startup or small business has minimal
individual impact, if a large number start asking the same questions and buying
based on environmental credentials, competition will emerge that differentiates
based on that.

## My startup isn’t about climate change / the environment / air quality / etc

Tesla is a very different company from Stripe. The mission of the former is to
“accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy” whereas the latter’s
mission is to “increase the GDP of the internet”, primarily through payment
processing.

Both companies have huge mission goals and are both having an impact on climate
change, but only one is focused directly on the environment.

It is perfectly reasonable to want to create a small business that will generate
a nice income for you just as it is perfectly reasonable to want to start a $bn
company that can IPO in 7-12 years, solving a massive global problem.

Where your company sits on the Human Perspectives graph is a useful thought
experiment, especially [when evaluating
ideas](https://davidmytton.blog/tools-for-evaluating-startup-business-ideas/).

![Illustration of human perspectives](human-perspectives.png "Although the
perspectives of the world's people vary in space and time, every human concern
falls somewhere on the space-time graph. Only a very few people have a global
perspective that extends far into the future. From: [The Limits to Growth: A
Report for the Club of Rome’s Project on the Predicament of
Mankind](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2808796011)")

Wherever the mission of the company might be placed on the graph, there are
multiple ways to extend impact far into the future. Tesla does this directly
through its mission but that’s not the only option. Stripe are doing it through
how they operate their company, initially with a [2017 commitment to being
carbon
neutral](https://increment.com/energy-environment/stripes-carbon-neutral-journey/) and
then in 2019 by [committing to
net-negative](https://stripe.com/blog/negative-emissions-commitment).

Every company can have a positive impact on the environment. It doesn’t have to
be the direct mission.

## Sustainability as a competitive differentiator

“Sustainable” products currently tend to be placed more in the “premium” product
bracket, but that doesn’t limit the market opportunity.

![Sustainable product sales in the US](nielsen-sustainable-product-sales.png "Graph of sustainable product sales in the US. From:
[Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2018/was-2018-the-year-of-the-influential-sustainable-consumer/)")

In [a 2018 survey of 550 EU companies across 8 product
categories](https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/eu_market_for_sustainable_products_report_final.pdf) (beverages,
clothing, computers, food, household and office furniture, mobile phones,
printed materials, toys and games), it was reported that:

- 85% of retailers reported increased sales of sustainable products over the
  past five years
- 92% of retailers expect sales in sustainable products to increase in the next
  five years
- On average, of the 127 companies that shared sales data, each retailer earned
  59% of its sales from sustainable products in 2017.

This trend also applies to the operations behind the scenes. According to a
survey by The Nielsen Company:

> 81% of global respondents feel strongly that companies should help improve the
> environment. This passion for corporate responsibility is shared across gender
> lines and generations. Millennials, Gen Z and Gen X are the most supportive,
> but their older counterparts aren’t far behind
>
> <cite>[The evolution of the sustainability
> mindset](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2018/the-education-of-the-sustainable-mindset/#consumers-demand-sustainability)</cite>

The sustainability effect extends to the entire company, not just the product:

> The emphasis on environmentally-friendly products, fair and ethical trade, and
> decent jobs in supplier companies has strong consumer support. But sustainable
> sourcing also draws equally strong support from the retailers themselves. Most
> expect such business to increase significantly in the next five years.
>
> <cite>[The European Union Market for Sustainable Products: The Retail
> Perspective on sourcing policies and consumer
> demand](https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/eu_market_for_sustainable_products_report_final.pdf)</cite>

This is converting into real spending power:

> Nearly half (48%) of U.S. consumers say they would definitely or probably
> change their consumption habits to reduce their impact on the environment. And
> these consumers are putting their dollars where their values are, spending
> $128.5 billion on sustainable fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products this
> year\*. Since 2014, these influential shoppers have grown sustainable product
> sales by nearly 20%, with a compound average growth rate (CAGR) that’s four
> times larger than conventional products (3.5% vs -1.0%\*\* comparatively). By
> 2021, we expect these sustainably minded shoppers to spend up to $150 billion
> on sustainable FMCG goods an increase of $14 billion – $22 billion
>
> <cite>[Was 2018 the year of the influential sustainable
> customer?](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2018/was-2018-the-year-of-the-influential-sustainable-consumer/)</cite>

For startups, this means that sustainability can be a product differentiator and
slightly higher prices won’t necessarily put off consumers. This can be built
into the company as well as the product.

Consider the success of entire companies built around this ethos, [such as
Patagonia](https://www.fastcompany.com/3038557/the-purpose-driven-marketer-how-patagonia-uses-storytelling-to-turn-consume).
Some of the Patagonia products might not be as environmentally friendly as
others, but you are buying into a brand which says it cares about reaching an
ultimate goal and is operating in a certain way.

> world and not just a marketer selling fleece to the active affluent in Soho.

## Where to start?

Like “cloud”, the meaning of “sustainable” is vague and is often defined to suit
a specific agenda. This often manifests itself in “greenwashing”.

> Greenwashing is a form of spin, in which a business or organization gives the
> false impression that its products and/or services are environmentally
> friendly. It’s a way of exploiting the public’s desire to change its
> consumption habits. Many firms want to seem green, but in fact are not and
> therefore come across as liars or hypocrites.
>
> <cite>[Caradonna, Jeremy L, Sustainability (p. 258)](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2933866898)</cite>

It is therefore important to adopt principles which are clear, transparent and
easy to measure. There are marketing benefits from adopting sustainable
operational practices, but that is not the only reason.

Creating a definition of what your company understands by the terms
“sustainable” and “environmentally friendly” is the first step to deciding what
to actually do about it. The areas to consider are:

- Energy
- Green building
- Transportation
- Financial / accounting
- Social justice, equality, well-being

## Energy

Aiming to become carbon-neutral and to use 100% renewable energy is probably the
first thing that comes to mind when thinking about climate change. It’s
something you can achieve in your personal life by switching utility providers
at home. This is a good place to begin for startups as well.

### Direct energy usage

Changing utility providers and/or switching to a 100% “green” tariff is easy. If
you own or lease your office building, this is usually a short phone call away
from implementing.

Energy is also easy to measure. Examining your utility bills provides precise
usage analysis which is useful to track reductions over time as well as giving
reliable values if you wish to buy carbon offsets.

This becomes more challenging if you are in a co-working space. This should be
one of the questions you ask when evaluating which one to choose. For example,
WeWork has publicly committed to being carbon neutral by 2023:

> WeWork is committed to being fully carbon neutral across our global operations
> no later than 2023. We believe in sustainable energy and as a global company
> with locations in more than 23 countries, we have an opportunity to explore
> new resources in places that will create the most impact. We have also become
> members of RE100 along with other industry leaders that have promised to do
> their part.
>
> <cite>[WeWork Commits to Being Carbon Neutral by
> 2023](https://www.wework.com/newsroom/posts/wework-commits-to-being-carbon-neutral-by-2023)</cite>

### Indirect energy usage

Office energy usage is the easiest place to start but there are many ways that
startups use energy indirectly, the biggest of which is likely to be through IT.

Nobody sane runs their own servers any more – most IT is outsourced either to
Google, Microsoft or Amazon.

- If you are using G Suite for email, calendar, docs, etc then [Google has been
  running its infrastructure on 100% renewable energy since
  2017](https://sustainability.google/projects/announcement-100/). This includes
  Google Cloud.
- Microsoft has been [carbon neutral for all of its operations and data centres
  since
  2012](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/03/21/new-solar-deal-moves-us-ahead-of-schedule-in-creating-a-cleaner-cloud/) and
  is at 50% renewables, [hitting 60% in 2019 and aiming for 70% by
  2023](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/04/15/were-increasing-our-carbon-fee-as-we-double-down-on-sustainability/).
- Amazon is the worst performer of the three major cloud providers, [achieving
  50% renewable power in
  2018](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/sustainability-timeline/).
  It has a goal of 100% but has no timeline. This is also limited to AWS rather
  than the whole of Amazon’s operations. However, if you deploy your
  infrastructure into specific AWS regions then they are supposed to be carbon
  neutral: US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt and Ireland) and Canada
  (Central). Unfortunately, the lack of transparency over what this actually
  means has been [criticised by
  Greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-is-amazons-new-german-data-center-really-carbon-neutral/).

Modern software is deployed as a service, which means less control over where it
actually runs. However, the advantage of SaaS is that once the vendor decides to
become carbon neutral and apply their own approach to sustainability, it applies
to all of their customers with no additional effort.

AWS has the largest market share so vendors you pick for your internal SaaS
tools are most likely to be deployed there – something you won’t be able to
control.

Environmental credentials should still be part of your buying process though. If
enough pre-sales questions involve sustainability questions, SaaS vendors will
either reconsider their infrastructure choices or start mitigating their
emissions in other ways. [Stripe is hosted on
AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/stripe/) but is still able to
be carbon neutral.

## Green building

In the US, 80% of emissions in some urban areas can be directly tied to
buildings through heating, maintenance and cooling. The buildings sector
accounts for about 76 percent of electricity use and 40 percent of U.S. primary
energy use and associated GHG emissions.

> What makes a building green or sustainable? In general, a sustainable building
> is one that runs on renewable energy sources, reduces (or eliminates) waste
> and pollution, uses energy and water very efficiently, is built with safe and
> environmentally friendly materials, is integrated into the local community and
> transportation networks, and promotes health, safety, and well-being.
>
> <cite>[Caradonna, Jeremy L, Sustainability (p. 197)](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2933866898)</cite>

The good news is that there are well established methods of quantitatively
assessing the sustainability of buildings, backed by real science.

The LEED certification (scored out of 100) developed by the non-profit U.S.
Green Building Council looks at a range of key factors around energy efficiency,
water usage, materials and environment quality. All 100,000+ certified projects
are [listed on the LEED website](https://www.usgbc.org/projects).

An alternative certification is BREEAM, created by the Building Research
Establishment in the UK. [They also have a project
directory](https://tools.breeam.com/projects/explore/map.jsp) with over 250,000
certified buildings listed.

For startups and small businesses, this simply means picking a location from the
directory and/or asking for the LEED / BREEAM score when evaluating office
locations. Certified buildings also tend to have a side advantage of [looking
really nice too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkI035BaowI).

## Transportation

Walking, biking and public transport as methods of commuting are essential to
reducing the impact of cars.

> By the year 2000, in the United States alone, cars had killed or maimed over
> 250 million people, consumed over 8 million barrels of oil every day, created
> dependencies on foreign oil, required $200 million in maintenance costs per
> day, killed a million wild animals per week, created noise, exacerbated health
> problems (asthma, emphysema, and so on), emitted enormous quantities of GHGs,
> and generated 7 billion pounds of unrecycled scrap and waste every year.60 A
> gallon of gas that is burned in a combustion engine emits about 19 pounds of
> CO2, and an additional 9 pounds are emitted in the production and processing
> of the fuel.
>
> <cite>[Caradonna, Jeremy L, Sustainability (p. 204)](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2933866898)</cite>

[In
Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/knowledge/pedestrians/pedestrians_and_cyclists_unprotected_road_users/walking_and_cycling_as_transport_modes_en),
walking is the main method of transport in 12-30% of all journeys (depending on
country, with the UK being highest) and 3-28% of trips are by bike (with the
Netherlands cycling the most). Of those trips, 30-40% of cycling is for
commuting.

Startups and small businesses can encourage this behaviour firstly by
considering the office location. Is it near public transport? What are the
pedestrian routes like? Does it have bike storage, showers and lockers for staff
to change when they arrive? Are there dangerous roads nearby which would
discourage biking?

Incentives can also help. In the UK, employers are [allowed to provide loans and
season tickets for public
transport](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-public-transport) so long as
they are reported correctly. The [Cycle to Work
scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-to-work-scheme-implementation-guidance) also
provides tax benefits to employees.

An even more efficient method of sustainable transport is not to have to travel
in the first place! The number of remote workers in the US [grew by
79%](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=0) between
2005 and 2012. The US Government [issues annual reports on its approach to
teleworking](https://www.telework.gov/reports-studies/reports-to-congress/annual-reports/).
For fiscal year 2017, they report:

> improved attainment of goals in almost every area: improved employee
> attitudes; emergency preparedness; recruitment; retention; reduced employee
> commute miles; improved employee performance; and reduced real estate costs
>
> <cite>[2018 Telework Report to
>  Congress](https://www.telework.gov/reports-studies/reports-to-congress/2018-report-to-congress.pdf)</cite>

Remote, distributed working is growing and is likely to be the future of working
practice. There are examples of successful companies at all sizes but [it needs
deliberate thought and
planning](https://davidmytton.blog/a-guide-to-remote-working-for-startups/) to
make sure it works.

## Financial / accounting

Growth is assumed to be the overall economic goal, which is why there is so much
emphasis placed on GDP as the main indicator of economic health. This
fundamental truth is being questioned by economists focused on
sustainability: [is the ultimate purpose endless growth of an
economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZsp_EdO2Xk)?

What is relevant to macro economics is less relevant to startups and small
businesses. Whether they aim for growth and how rapid it needs to be all depends
on the type of business. The idea of a “startup” implies growth, and is required
if the VC backed model is being followed. [But that is a
choice](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-we-choose-profit/). A “small business” of
just a few people might be very happy to run a business that makes a nice profit
at a sustainable level.

On an even more micro level, the standard accounting approach to measuring top
and bottom line profit has no mechanism for considering environmental impact. An
alternative option is [Triple Bottom Line
(TBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line) which has 3 parts:
social, environmental (or ecological) and financial.

![Illustration of the triple bottom line](triple-bottom-line.jpg "Aspects of
Triple Bottom Line accounting. Economic, Social and Environment. From
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line).")

The challenge with the TBL method is that it is not an official accounting
standard and very few companies have adopted it directly. However, it has
inspired other types of sustainability reporting standards, the most widely used
of which are the GRI Standards:

> The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards ([GRI
> Standards](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards)) are the first and most
> widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting. Since GRI’s
> inception in 1997, we have transformed it from a niche practice to one now
> adopted by a growing majority of organizations. In fact, 93% of the world’s
> largest 250 corporations report on their sustainability performance

Another widely used and recognised mechanism is
the [B-Corp](https://bcorporation.net/). This includes a TBL concept but in a
way that is much easier to deploy.

> Certified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of
> verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal
> accountability to balance profit and purpose.

The B-Corp is not just about certification. Certified B Corporations also [amend
their legal governing
documents](https://bcorporation.net/certification/legal-requirements) to require
their board of directors to balance profit and purpose.

This approach became mainstream in 2019 with [181 large corporates committing to
diversifying the purpose of
business](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49400885) to incorporate more than
just “shareholder value”.

## Social justice, equality, well-being

> Sustainists contend that a sustainable society is one that not only preserves
> natural capital, eliminates waste, and establishes economic stability but also
> promotes human happiness, equality, and well-being. This emphasis on human
> welfare is one of the central features that separates classic environmentalism
> from the sustainability movement.
>
> <cite>[Caradonna, Jeremy L, Sustainability (p. 220)](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2933866898)</cite>

For startups, company policies can be a true differentiator and often
distinguish them from small businesses and larger corporates. This isn’t just
about [the failed idea of unlimited
holiday](https://davidmytton.blog/startup-holiday-policies-unlimited-time-off-doesnt-work/) but
incorporates all HR policies, from generous maternity and paternity pay to [how
potential employees are treated during the hiring
process](https://davidmytton.blog/how-to-hire-engineers-the-interview-process/).

This is what [the HumanOps
movement](https://davidmytton.blog/a-practical-guide-to-humanops-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-started/) is
about, but applied more generally to all startups. The key principles are:

1. Humans build & operate systems that have critical business impact.
2. Humans require downtime. They get tired, get stressed and need breaks.
3. As a result, human wellbeing directly impacts system operations.
4. As a result, human wellbeing has a direct impact on critical business
   systems.

[The principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKwfgtGyrpk) originated from
technical IT operations but can really apply to the entire operating procedures
of the whole company.

## Where to go from here?

At Stripe, it all started with a single question:

> What would it take to make Stripe carbon neutral?
>
> <cite>[Stripe’s carbon-neutral
> journey](https://increment.com/energy-environment/stripes-carbon-neutral-journey/)</cite>

Startups exist to deliver innovative products but they also create innovative
business models and change how things work. That should include leading the way
on helping to combat climate change.

There are things we can do
as [individuals](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/), [consumers](https://www.tmrow.com/climatechange) and [policy
makers](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/pathways-to-a-low-carbon-economy),
so why shouldn’t we expect startups to contribute as well?
