The 2019 General Election may have had Brexit slogans but the environment has
still been a key topic – 21% of people cited it as one of the most important
issues, compared to 2% in 2012 (Webster, 2019). As a result, all parties
released a detailed set of environmental pledges.

Fracking and trees have hit the headlines during this election period (Google
Trends, 2019), but with the pre-election publication of the Environment Bill
2019 there are already detailed proposals for more systemic changes around
resource efficiency and the circular economy. This essay will compare party
pledges related to this before evaluating two pledges in terms of their
feasibility, economic impact and overall potential environmental benefit.

## 1. Comparing manifesto pledges

Political manifestos contain a variety of pledges, so it is necessary to
precisely scope the selection of policies for comparison. For the purpose of
this essay, only policies relating to resource efficiency and the circular
economy are being considered. This means first defining those terms.

### 1.1 Defining “resource efficiency”

“Resource efficiency” includes a broad set of concepts related to how natural
resources are used within the economy (Voulvoulis, 2019). Typically related to
providing specific goods and services, it includes understanding the quantity of
materials, energy and water alongside how productive they are in terms of unit
output (Voulvoulis, 2019). Placed in a policy context, this is defined in the
Environment Bill as related to product lifecycle: design, cost, upgradeability,
repair and disposal (Great Britain. *Environment Bill 2019*).

### 1.2 Defining “circular economy”

A general definition of a “circular economy” is one which is designed to
minimise losses, so that “waste” is considered part of the process, not an
end (Voulvoulis, 2019). The 3Rs – reduce, reuse, recycle are fundamental to
avoiding designed obsolescence (Voulvoulis, 2019) and are part of Sustainable
Development Goals 9 and 12 (United Nations, 2015). This definition is often
expanded to include an additional R – recover – and can also include
considerations of economic prosperity and social equity (Kirchherr, *et
al.* 2017). A deeper systems perspective – considering the full lifecycle,
economic incentives and how resources are a part of that – is an important
aspect of the definition because otherwise the circular economy could simply be
grouped under “resource efficiency” (Kirchherr, *et al.* 2017). Systemic change
is required to create true sustainability, defined as meeting today’s needs
without affecting future generations (Brundtland, *et al.* 1987).

### 1.3 Method: Categorising pledges

At the dissolution of Parliament on 6th November 2019, the Conservative and
Labour parties made up 541 of 650 seats, holding 298 and 243 seats respectively
(UK Parliament, 2019). The third largest party, the Scottish Nationalist Party,
held only 35 seats. Only the manifestos of the two largest parties have been
considered here.

The two manifestos are unstructured, containing a variety of background
statements and specific pledges. Text is split into paragraphs, often but not
always representing those specific pledges. Neither manifesto mentions the
keywords “resource efficiency” or “circular economy”. As a result, pledges have
been categorised manually.

Pledges have been split into two types: specific and implied. The former counts
pledges specifically about “resource efficiency” or the “circular economy”,
defined above. For example, “We will continue to lead the world in tackling
plastics pollution” (The Conservative and Unionist Party, 2019) is considered a
specific pledge. In contrast, “implied” pledges do not mention aspects of the
above definitions but may involve them. For example, “We will maintain and
continuously improve the existing EU standards of environmental regulation”
(Labour, 2019a) is considered an implied pledge because EU environmental law
includes, for example, Council Directive 2008/98/EC on waste.

Each pledge has been assigned a category and counted. With additional time, a
more rigorous approach to contextual analysis could be applied, perhaps
following The Content Analysis Guidebook (2016).

Labour did publish a separate Manifesto for the Environment (Labour, 2019b)
which repeats several of the pledges in their central manifesto. However, due to
limited time, only the main manifestos were analysed; otherwise we would also
need to examine the full Environment Bill since it is cited in the Conservative
manifesto.

### 1.4. Results

The Conservative manifesto contains 13 pledges: 5 implied and 8 specific. The
Labour manifesto contains 14 pledges: 9 implied and 5 specific (figure 1-1).
Full categorisation can be found in Appendix A.

![Graph of pledges per category](count-of-pledges-per-category.png "**Figure
1-1**: Count of pledges per category in Conservative and Labour manifestos.")

Both parties have a similar number of pledges, but the Conservative manifesto
includes more specific pledges than Labour. One reason for this may be that the
Conservatives were in government and have been able to consult on new
environmental measures (DEFRA, 2019a). This culminated in the publication of the
Environment Bill just prior to the dissolution of Parliament (Great
Britain. *Environment Bill 2019*).  Labour does not have access to the resources
of government, so their pledges tend to be more “implied”. We would have
expected them to develop a more specific policy agenda had they won the
election.

## 2. Evaluating manifesto pledges

The remainder of this essay evaluates two pledges from the “specific” category
present in both party manifestos: a) extended producer responsibility; b)
deposit return schemes. These were chosen because they are supported by both
manifestos and there is detailed material available to evaluate them. “Implied”
pledges are more difficult to evaluate in terms of their feasibility, economic
impact, and overall potential environmental benefit because they are too broad.

### 2.1. Extended producer responsibility

Producers have been responsible for their packaging waste since the 1994 EU
Council Directive 94/62/EC, implemented in the UK Environment Act 1995. Although
there was initial rapid progress against the 2020 50% household waste recycling
target (Council Directive 2008/98/EC), it has plateaued in recent years and as
of 2017 stands at 45.7% (DEFRA, 2019b), possibly due to high costs (Great
Britain. House of Commons Library, 2019). However, when looking only at
packaging, the UK exceeds its EU target with 70% of packaging recovered or
recycled (DEFRA, 2019b).

The main criticism of the current scheme is it relies on exporting waste without
monitoring whether it is actually recycled (National Audit Office, 2018).
Further, producers do not seem to be incentivised to minimise their packaging
because they are only responsible for some of the costs (Great Britain. House of
Commons Library, 2019), sometimes only 10% (House of Commons, 2017).

The government accepted these criticisms and published improvement direction in
its 2018 waste strategy (HM Government, 2018). This was consulted on in 2019
(DEFRA, 2019c) and the results became the measures in the Environment Bill 2019.
Schedule 4 and schedule 6 are the key sections which create powers for ministers
to regulate producer responsibility. Schedule 4, paragraph 3(2)(b) specifically
allows producers to be charged to meet their scheme obligations, calculated to
cover the net lifecycle costs not just the recycling cost (DEFRA, 2019d). This
is designed as an economic incentive for producers backed by enforcement
provisions in part 2 of schedule 6 (DEFRA, 2019d).

However, many of the Environment Bill provisions only create powers to introduce
changes, rather than introducing changes themselves. The bill makes amendments
to the existing Environment Act 1995 to allow ministers to create regulations at
a later date. For example, schedule 4, paragraph 3(2)(b) amends Environment Act
1995 section 94 subsection (1)(d) to allow for a fee but does not introduce the
fee itself. The government has said they will do this following consultation in
2020 (HM Government, 2019a).

The industry has welcomed these changes (CIWM, 2019) but unfortunately the
general election has stalled progress. Since the Conservatives specifically
mention the Environment Bill and extended producer responsibility in their
manifesto, we can assume they are likely to bring it back if they win. Labour
also have a pledge to introduce more producer responsibility but what form that
would take is unspecified.

The feasibility of these manifesto pledges has been demonstrated by the
consultation process already undertaken, and acceptance by industry. By
accounting for the full costs of the lifecycle of a product, the price will more
accurately reflect external costs as well as private costs (Field & Field,
2016). Not only does this place additional responsibility on the producer, the
consumer takes responsibility in their acceptance of the price. This is expected
to have an economic impact on quantity demanded and on the share of the costs
borne by taxpayers (House of Commons, 2017). Shared responsibility is important
because producers only create products to fulfil consumer demand – both must
play their part (Lenzen, *et al.*, 2007).

Whether this ultimately has a positive environmental impact remains to be seen.
The trend to date looks promising but the criticisms above suggest the true
impact is still unknown (National Audit Office, 2018).

### 2.2. Deposit return schemes

14 billion plastic drinks bottles, 9 billion cans and 5 billion glass bottles
are used in the UK each year (VEIWG, 2018). As part of examining how to reduce
litter, in 2017 the government investigated whether deposit return schemes (DRS)
could help (DEFRA, 2017). Although it did not find direct evidence DRS decreased
littering, it did discover that DRS can increase the number of beverage
containers collected by 20% (VEIWG, 2018). Following that report, the government
published plans to consult on DRS proposals (HM Government, 2018) which
concluded in 2019 (HM Government, 2019b).

When evaluating environmental policies, it is important to consider how fair
they are (Field & Field, 2016) – additional charges on products may have social
justice concerns. This was anticipated in the consultation which suggested that
milk or plant-based drinks containers would not fall under the scope of the DRS
because they are essential products, in contrast to soft drinks and alcohol
(DEFRA, 2019e). Although the consultation concluded with majority support for
collecting all types of containers, the response stated that the design and
scope would be subject to further consultation (HM Government, 2019b).

Other countries already have DRS in place, which allows environmental impact to
be analysed. The recycle rate varies by country and container material but
within the EU recycling rates are between 87-97% (VEIWG, 2018). This compares to
70% in the UK (HM Government, 2018).

Whether this is cost-effective depends on how the scheme operates and must
include initial setup costs plus ongoing transport, staffing, administration and
IT (VEIWG, 2018). Estimates range from £700m-£1bn annually, with revenue
estimates of £3-4bn annually, assuming a deposit fee of £0.15-£0.20 (VEIWG,
2018). Aside from the costs to industry of the scheme itself, mandating package
recycling ensures the external costs of raw materials are priced into the
initial purchase thereby pushing the market to reuse rather than extract virgin
materials (VEIWG, 2018). This is a key aspect of the circular
economy (Voulvoulis, 2019).

As with extended producer responsibility above, the powers to introduce DRS have
already been proposed in Schedule 9 of the Environment Bill 2019. The same
criticisms apply – these are just the necessary powers rather than the immediate
establishment of DRS. Both Labour and Conservatives have pledged support in
their manifestos but even though the environmental and economic benefit seem
clear, a key political question of fairness remains unresolved.

## 3. Conclusions

We know that firms will try and minimise their private costs, but external costs
tend not to be accounted for (Field & Field, 2016). Introducing producer
responsibility for the supply chain in 1994 was an initial attempt at dealing
with external costs but did not cover the full lifecycle. Producers were
absolved of responsibility post-sale and since the price did not accurately
reflect the true cost, consumers made choices that had a negative impact on the
environment.

Both political parties seem to agree with the need to address major
environmental challenges and are proposing systemic changes by properly
accounting for external costs, implementing ideas from the circular economy
(even if they don’t use the phrase). The Conservatives have benefitted from the
resources of government in developing their pledges, but it is clear both
parties agree that responsibility should be shared between producers and
consumers. How this will be implemented will depend on how the programme of
government progresses next.
