Cyber security is no longer something that can just be swept under the
rug: [recent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/12/uk-cyber-attacks-ncsc-russia-china-ciaran-martin) cyber
attacks in the UK have shown that no one is immune. The stats are worrying - in
2016, two thirds of large businesses had a cyber attack or breach, according
to [Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/two-thirds-of-large-uk-businesses-hit-by-cyber-breach-or-attack-in-past-year) research. [Accenture](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/most-firms-face-significant-daily-or-weekly-cyberattacks-accenture.html) paints
a bleaker picture, suggesting that two thirds of companies globally face these
attacks weekly, or even daily.

If you run a website, it's likely you know how prevalent cyber attacks can be in
the private sector. Unfortunately most businesses aren't up to speed with how to
mitigate the damage if an attack occurs - in fact, the Government's [2016 cyber
security breaches
survey](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/most-firms-face-significant-daily-or-weekly-cyberattacks-accenture.html) discovered
only a third of the firms surveyed has cyber security policies in place, and
only 10% had an emergency plan.

This lack of awareness and preparedness is strange, considering a
recent [poll](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450300330/Cyber-attacks-cost-UK-business-more-than-34bn-a-year-study-shows)shows
that the annual cost of cyber security incidents to UK companies is over £34bn.
It's not a matter of if, but of when, so read on to learn what your priorities
should be when it happens to you.

## Plan ahead

There's no predicting when a cyber attack might come, whether it be in the form
of a DDoS, a virus, malware, or phishing. It's therefore important to be
constantly vigilant, and prepared for incidents when they do occur.

A key first step is to create a well-structured recovery plan. For example -
most people think that making regular backups will suffice, but they often fail
to take into account that these backups may be corrupted - a recent example of
this was GitLab's high-profile data
loss [incident](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450300330/Cyber-attacks-cost-UK-business-more-than-34bn-a-year-study-shows).
You should be running regular tests on these backups so that you can restore
your systems.

While it may seem self-evident, making a checklist is incredibly helpful.
Everyone gets stressed and forgets things under pressure, and suffering from a
cyber attack is no different. Every company should have a list of key tasks to
undertake during and after an attack, and each of those tasks should have a
clear owner. By being prepared, you minimise the risk of unforeseen
complications causing further damage.

Test your plan with regular simulations and practice runs. If you can simulate a
situation, it'll be easier for you to react when the time does come. For
example, a DDoS attack may begin with a monitoring alert to let you know your
application is slow. Your checklist would start with the initial diagnostics to
pinpoint the cause, but as soon as you discover it is a DDoS attack then the
security response plan should take over. You need to make sure that the on-call
team know how to escalate to the security responders, and that those responders
have all the tools they need to handle the issue (of course, they may be the
same people in smaller teams). This may involve letting other, more senior
members of staff know, as well as requesting the appropriate assistance from
your security vendors. Your plan should include steps to document everything,
assigning responsibilities along the way. Nobody should be unsure of what their
job is.

Communication is key. Your response teams should be properly briefed on policies
for announcing the problems both internally to the relevant teams inside your
company as well as out to customers. Consistent messaging with regular updates
is important to avoid confusion. This will prevent a greater loss of trust from
your stakeholders and customers.

## IT staff are people, too

With the rise of the SaaS products we've become so accustomed to being several
stages removed from underlying systems we often forget that there are people
behind the scenes keeping everything running. Every system, no matter its size,
has a group of IT workers who have to deal with security issues at all times,
but especially so when the system breaks.

Humans make mistakes. Amazon's recent AWS
S3 [outage](https://data-economy.com/aws-massive-cloud-outage-proves-no-one-immune-downtime/) shows
that - swathes of the internet were taken offline due to one programmer's typo.
There's an unfortunate trend within the developer community to be 'sysadmin
superheroes', and this is counterproductive. Sysadmins are plagued with stress
and fatigue like everyone else, and ignoring this can lead to dangerous
situations. Cyberattacks and security issues will place tremendous stresses on
your IT workers. This can be counteracted with general awareness campaigns.

Recognising that humans build and fix systems is important for everyone's
wellbeing, and movements like [HumanOps](http://www.humanops.com/) can help.
Humans are subject to emotions, and it's important to adapt and adjust
expectations on a business level. This should make employees more productive, as
well as create an improvement in their work-life balance.

## Keeping your website up & more

It may be standard industry policy to focus on basic site uptime as a main
metric to assess security, but a cyber attack might be more subtle than simply
taking your whole website down.

Website defacement is very common, and it can really affect a company's
reputation. Part or the whole of a website's content is changed by hackers
externally, often with a negative outcome. One recent example is Google Brazil,
whose systems
were [hacked](https://www.hackread.com/lone-hacker-defaces-google-brazil-domain/) by
a single individual early this year. This goes to show that no company is secure
in an age when cyber attacks are everywhere.

One way to protect yourself from this kind of attack is by investing in
feature-rich monitoring tools. Some tools can tell you more about your page than
if it's up or not - rather, they can tell you when there are changes to pages,
errors or even if the site is suddenly being redirected.

A cyber attack can cause a lot of panic, but with these suggestions in place,
you should be able to avoid extended downtime and significant financial damage.
Having a plan in place will lead the way for what to do in an emergency, as well
as reduce confusion. You may not be able to prevent a cyber attack, but you now
have everything in your hands to survive one.
