When I sold my SaaS startup, [I wrote about the three things I would do
differently if I did it
again](https://davidmytton.blog/3-lessons-from-9-years-of-startups/). Reading
more books was number one.

I used to read a lot when I was younger but at some point between starting my
company in 2009 and selling it in 2018, I stopped reading books. I still read
articles, blog posts and but it was books that somehow disappeared.

In my final year as CEO, I set up a book club with my executive team. As a
result, we engaged better as a group, debated ideas and implemented many
valuable changes. This is because books allow for depth. Ideas can be explored,
stories told and concepts explained in more depth than short articles. I wish I
had restarted reading books sooner.

Since 2017, I challenged myself to read more. Initially aiming for quantity to
get back into the habit, that goal has changed to aim for quality.

This post looks at why startup founders
and [CEOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTFy8RnUkoU) should read, what to
read and how to find it. At the end I list my top 10 books for startup founders,
4 of which are nothing to do with startups. I also track all the books I read
on [my reading list](https://davidmytton.blog/reading/).

## Why should startup founders read?

Startup time runs faster than real-time. There are too many things to do, so
much that reading feels like a luxury. But the pressure to execute meant I
sacrificed a big part of learning how. The key word is: *learning*.

I find that [I do not remember specifics of most of the books I
read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQOrqAKKcUQ). Over time I even forget
whether I have read a particular book. However, the concepts remain. They build
on each other. I might not remember where I read about an idea but the important
things come back at the right time.

I prefer reading non-fiction in eBook format because I highlight key passages
and store them in a
searchable [notebook](https://davidmytton.blog/the-best-note-taking-apps-for-mac-markdown-open-format-cross-platform/).
A “quote of the day” script I wrote picks a random highlight from my Kindle and
emails it to me ([Readwise](https://readwise.io/) is a paid service which does
the same). The Kindle Paperwhite is better than an iPad or phone because it has
fewer options for distraction. It is too easy to flip open a browser on an iPad
or get notifications on a phone.

Finding time to read is difficult. I read for at least an hour before bed but
that is fiction to help me get to sleep. For non-fiction, when I was CEO I would
block an hour in my calendar each day to sit quietly and read. If you do not set
aside specific time you will find it difficult to get large enough blocks of
time to focus. Travel time and audiobooks help to make the most of available
time but I consider dedicated reading time an essential part of my daily
routine.

Successful founders must be focused and [filter out
distractions](http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html) but this prevents
discovering new ideas. Unlike articles, blog posts, Twitter and forums, books
also require focus. Some books are too long and many should just be articles,
but [a book is still the best way to go into depth on a
topic](https://craigmod.com/essays/media_accounting/).

The rapid pace of change is what makes startups so difficult. In an established
business, you hire an experienced specialist in each role. In a startup, the
roles change every 12-18 months. What is working now will soon break. Teams
either continuously reinvent themselves or they fail.

> When hiring executives, look for people who have the experience and background
> that would make them a good fit or hire for the next 12–18 months. Anything
> shorter than that and they will not be able to scale sufficiently far relative
> to the time it takes to hire them. Anything longer and you will over-hire and
> end up with someone who is a bad fit for the job.
>
> <cite>Elad Gil, High Growth Handbook.</cite>

Without learning about the ideas, successes and failures of others, a startup
founder will make unnecessary mistakes or execute sub-optimally. This is “just
in time” learning: reading about a problem you are about to face, or currently
facing, helps with solving acute issues.

Startup books are useful for exploring these specific issues, but they are not
the only thing startup founders and CEOs should read.

## What should startup founders read?

The best way to learn about business is to run one. Startup and business books
are useful if you have a specific problem. However, just like doing an
MBA, [most business books are a waste of
time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz3Kdn91ZOQ).

Startup founders must operate under a high degree of uncertainty. The way to
make decisions in situations with imperfect information is through the
application of [first
principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle). This means reading
about history, science and philosophy.

There are no “correct” books to read. There are too many to choose from, so pick
something you think you will find interesting. Avoid reading what might seem
“useful” or what everyone is talking about. New books come out all the time,
constantly pulling for your attention.

I try to go for variety. Looking [my reading
list](https://davidmytton.blog/reading/), the latest few books were on economic
history (2007), a history of ancient Rome (2015), a history of the lead up to
World War I (1962), Japanese philosophy (1340) and startup culture (2019).
Diversity of topic, publication date and author.

[History is particularly
important](https://www.belfercenter.org/project/applied-history-project).
Understanding what has happened in the past is crucial to understanding the
present and predicting the future. Most of the reading I have been doing
around [understanding the coronavirus
pandemic](https://davidmytton.blog/two-phase-pandemic/) has drawn on historical
precedent. What happened in the last financial crisis and the last pandemic?
What does this mean we should do now?

## How to find the best books to read

If I expect to read 20 books in a year and [my life expectancy is
85](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/articles/lifeexpectancycalculator/2019-06-07) that
means I only have ~1,000 books left. That sounds like a lot but in 2011 [184,000
books were published in the
UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per_year). There’s
no time for bad books!

My favourite way to discover new books is based on what other people have read
and recommend. Goodreads can be useful if your friends use it. I also like to
hear about the book recommendations of public figures I admire.

- [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books) is famous for his reviews and
  uses reading as a way to explore a wide range of deep, technical topics.
- Marc Andreessen seems to approach reading like Bill Gates, but is less
  public about it. Someone made [a historical list of books
  tweeted](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mmEKySwi0iYjWx_DoigL4y7_NflsT0bB0ZnibBFqSVs/edit#gid=0) and [he
  still occasionally tweets
  recommendations](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1251648508655923200).
- References in other books, whether specifically mentioned in-text or
  referenced in the notes or bibliography.
- Podcasts are often used as part of promoting new releases but guests will
  often mention other books. Tim Ferriss usually asks his podcast guests about
  their favourite books, so [search the list](https://tim.blog/podcast/) if
  someone you like has been on his podcast.

## The 10 best books for startup founders and CEOs

In 2017, I started [tracking all the books I
read](https://davidmytton.blog/reading/). This was originally on Goodreads, but
I wanted to own the data rather than giving it to Amazon. [I still think the
Kindle is great](https://davidmytton.blog/iuse/), but I want to control the
publication of my reading history.

Here are the top 10 books I recommend to startup founders and CEOs:

### For understanding the world

This is the most important category. If you don’t read any other books then at
least consider these.

- **The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World, Niall Ferguson**  
   Economic history is important to understand the system we all rely on. This
  book examines how money has developed and how complicated the monetary has
  become. The economy has cycles. Eventually you will experience a recession
  and whilst each one is different from the last, understanding what makes
  cycles happen helps to get through to the other side. [Some of the best
  businesses have been created during
  downturns](http://www.paulgraham.com/badeconomy.html) how do you stay calm
  in a cycle of doom? Understanding financial history puts everything into
  perspective because we have been here before.
- **The Lessons of History, Will Durant & Ariel Durant**  
   A lot of stuff has happened in the past! This is a very short book that
  takes you through key periods and extracts the lessons everyone needs to
  know. It is very high level and has a frustrating lack of references, but
  you can use it as a stepping stone to look into the areas you are interested
  in researching next.
- **[The Limits to Growth, Donella H.
  Meadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth)**  
   Although out of date, this book does an amazing job at explaining the
  unintuitive concept of exponential growth. It explains the massive
  environmental challenges we face and how technology and productivity work
  together. This is particularly relevant for those in the tech industry.
- **Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty, Daron
  Acemoğlu & James A. Robinson**  
   A case study approach to comparing different countries. What are the real
  differences between successful and failed states? If the answer is
  geography, why the difference between Mexico and USA? If the answer is
  common history then why North and South Korea? If the answer is the
  inevitable effects of colonialism, why Botswana vs Zimbabwe?

### For creating ideas

- **Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice,
  Clayton M. Christensen**  
   The Job to be Done framework is one of many [tools for evaluating startup
  business
  ideas](https://davidmytton.blog/tools-for-evaluating-startup-business-ideas/).
  Although this book is wordy and fails to provide a simple step-by-step
  framework, the theory is still useful to understand what differentiates
  successful and failed startups.
- **Zero to One: Notes on Start Ups, or How to Build the Future, Peter Thiel &
  Blake Masters**  
   If you have ambitions to found a venture backed business that solves a
  massive problem, this is the best guide to thinking through those ideas. It
  inspires as well as helping to critically evaluate whether your idea will
  fit the criteria of an investable business. We have too many “Uber for x”
  and “pet social network” startups. More founders should read this and [solve
  some difficult problems](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/).
- **Rework, Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson**  
   The exact opposite of Zero to One. There is no right approach, but you must
  decide which one you wish to pursue. The idea of a “lifestyle business” has
  unfortunately become a derogatory term, but it is really just a choice about
  how you want to live. Generating a significant profit is a choice that can
  enable many other things. Some businesses are impossible without huge sums
  of money. Understand both, pick one.

### For new founders and the inexperienced

- **The Effective Executive, Peter Drucker**  
   The majority of this book seems like common sense, but only after you have
  spent 5-10 years trying to figure it out for yourself! For startup founders
  (or their direct reports) focused on delivery, this is a good primer. I
  don’t agree with everything, for example he thinks that meetings are a waste
  of time which is only true if they are not structured properly (see below).
  I also disagree that you have to put up with horrible people. With the
  abundance of amazing places to work, employees should quit to find better
  cultures, and founders should quickly fire anyone who is toxic.
- **The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No
  Easy Answers, Ben Horowitz**  
   This also fits in the “for running a startup” category below but I think it
  is just as useful for new founders to read. It reveals the true challenges
  you are about to face as well as offering practical advice for many common
  situations.

### For running a startup

- **The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable, Patrick Lencioni**  
   Culture is important but how do you actually create one that allows teams to
  function at their best? To be read alongside Death by Meeting, this is the
  book that had the most impact on how I ran my company. As CEO, it
  transformed how I ran my executive team and influenced how I ran the team I
  led once we were acquired by StackPath (300 people and generating $200m in
  annual revenue).
