In a previous post [I looked at the startup cleantech sector as a whole and the
data behind $49bn of cleantech investment since
2004](https://davidmytton.blog/the-data-behind-49bn-of-cleantech-investment/).

How few cleantech startups were getting funded stood out to me. **On average, 52
cleantech companies are founded each year**, tiny compared to e-commerce which
has seen an average of 988 companies founded per year since 2004.

However, things are looking a bit more positive with new activity from a number
of cleantech investors and a renewed focus on impact investing. [Aside from what
corporates can
do](https://davidmytton.blog/corporate-purchasing-an-unexpected-way-to-fight-climate-change/),
there seems to be a big opportunity for startups in a cleantech space with
plenty of available money and very little competition from other startups.

In this post I will look a bit closer at cleantech startups founded in the last
3 years. What is being started and where is the money going?

## Does cleantech require venture capital?

I have somewhat arbitrarily chosen to look back over the last 3 years. There are
many companies founded well before that but this timeframe should show what new
ideas are being launched. It should also be sufficient time for the most
interesting companies to have raised initial funding.

Unfortunately this does mean some companies that recently announced funding have
been cut off, due to when they were founded. For example, Breakthrough Energy
Ventures (BEV) announced their initial portfolio of 5 companies last year which
have a wide range of founding dates.

Funding is not necessarily an indicator of whether a cleantech company is
important. However, my assumption is that [given the capital intensive nature of
the
industry](https://davidmytton.blog/the-data-behind-49bn-of-cleantech-investment/),
most cleantech companies will require funding.

The cleantech sector seems similar to biotech where large sums are required to
develop and commercialise the product. This is in contrast to SaaS, for example,
where an initial product can be built entirely in-house with minimal funding,
and bootstrapping is a perfectly valid way to build a lasting business. [Scaling
a global SaaS business is another
matter](https://davidmytton.blog/you-cant-build-a-saas-company-in-2018-without-significant-funding/) but
a successful software company [can quite legitimately be built without outside
capital](https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider/).

## Cleantech startups over the last 3 years

Using Crunchbase to search for companies with the CleanTech and Clean Energy
categories that were founded in the last 3 years reveals 205 results.

**From those 205 companies, 65 have raised funding totalling $379 million. 63%
of those are classified as
“[Seed](https://medium.com/localglobe-notes/seed-has-come-of-age-bfbeb80a3b8)“**,
which is to be expected given the short life of the companies to date.

However, most that $379m is invested in just a small number of companies:

- [Commonwealth Fusion](https://www.cfs.energy/) ($115m raised), USA – fusion
  energy.
- [VOI Technology](https://www.voiscooters.com/) ($89m raised), Sweden –
  transport (scooters).
- [Dandelion Energy](https://dandelionenergy.com/) ($22.5m raised), USA –
  consumer geothermal.
- [Zer0 Box](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zero-box) ($14.9m raised),
  China – packaging.
- [Deep Isolation](http://www.deepisolation.com/) ($14.1m raised), USA) –
  nuclear waste management.

## Cleantech sub-sector investment

Energy and transportation probably have the most media hype of the cleantech
sub-sectors, but there are a broad range of other sub-sectors with startup
activity.

![Graph of companies with funding in Cleantech
sub-sectors](companies-with-funding-cleantech-sub-sectors.png "Companies with
funding in Cleantech sub-sectors")

![Graph of funding totals per Cleantech
sub-sector](funding-totals-per-cleantech-sub-sector.png "Funding totals per
Cleantech sub-sector")

By total number of companies founded in the last 3 years, the largest
sub-sectors are:

1. Transport – 23 companies
2. Energy Generation – 11 companies
3. Energy Efficiency – 11 companies
4. Water – 8 companies
5. Battery – 7 companies
6. Waste Management – 7 companies

![Graph of the top 6 Cleantech sub-sectors by number of
companies](companies-with-funding-cleantech-sub-sectors-top6.png "Top 6
Cleantech sub-sectors by number of companies")

And by total amount of funding raised:

1. Energy Generation – $157m
2. Transport – $90m
3. Packaging – $17m
4. Chemicals – $14m
5. Nuclear Waste – $14m
6. Battery – $11m

funding](funding-totals-per-cleantech-sub-sector-top6.png "Top 6 Cleantech
sub-sectors by total funding")

## Where are cleantech companies being founded and funded?

As expected, the US dominates both in terms of the number of cleantech companies
founded over the last 3 years (48, 36% of all companies), and by how much they
have raised in total funding ($180m, 53% of total funding).

| Country     | Companies | Total Raised    |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| USA         | 48        | US$ 180,586,000 |
| Canada      | 8         | US$ 22,380,000  |
| Switzerland | 6         | US$ 12,371,000  |
| Germany     | 8         | US$ 4,250,000   |
| UK          | 12        | US$ 3,371,000   |
| Israel      | 4         | US$ 3,000,000   |

Other countries represented in the list include Brazil, Sweden, France, Estonia,
Singapore, Turkey and India.

## What has been happening with cleantech startups over the last 3 years?

Looking through all the startups founded in cleantech over the last 3 years
shows a few interesting things:

- There are 140 companies without any form of funding, or that have not
  disclosed their funding yet. This is to be expected for the very early
  companies because they will not have reached a stage where they can raise
  funding yet. There is a spike of companies who have raised funding around
  12-18 months ago but the absolute numbers are still low.
- I would expect cleantech companies to be using pre-seed or seed money to
  commercialise their technology, then raise larger rounds to scale. For
  example, Commonwealth Fusion was founded in 2017 and raised a $115m Series A
  in Jun 2019 but [it was announced they had raised a smaller, undisclosed
  amount in Sept
  2018](https://qz.com/1402301/bill-gatess-1-billion-energy-fund-is-expanding-its-portfolio-of-startups-fighting-climate-change/).
  The product is a spin-out from MIT based on decades of research. Venture
  funding is ideal for one purpose – commercialisation.
- It is not surprising to find companies working in energy generation, solar and
  batteries, but there are some more unusual companies including several flying
  taxi startups e.g. [Ascendance Flight
  Technologies](https://www.ascendance-ft.com/).
- Startups that have raised the most tend to be in the US, unless they are
  localising products that have already been successful in the US e.g. [VOI
  Technology](https://www.voiscooters.com/) ($89m raised) for electric scooters
  in Sweden.
- The US dominates both in the total number of companies and the total funding
  raised, although cleantech investors are broadening their geographic reach
  such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures who announced [their €100m European fund
  in May
  2019](http://www.b-t.energy/ventures/breakthrough-energy-ventures-europe/).
- Certain countries have a higher density of specific, specialist startups e.g.
  2 of the 3 packaging startups – [Zer0
  Box](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zero-box) and [Huidu](https://huidugroup.cn/) –
  are based in China.

This supports my hypothesis that there is very little competition within
cleantech compared to other startup sectors, but where there is competition
cleantech follows the same rule as in SaaS: the top companies raise huge rounds
because [the winner takes
most](https://tomtunguz.com/does-winner-take-most-in-saas/).

Investors also need to be careful that they are funding companies that are
building a commercial product and not just continuing the funding of a
technology that should still be in the R&D phase. From looking at the startup
websites of many of the companies in the list, I got the impression that quite a
lot were still very early and might be better as research projects rather than
for-profit companies. This contrasts with SaaS where companies can launch with a
very early MVP but still have a commercial product that can be sold immediately.
