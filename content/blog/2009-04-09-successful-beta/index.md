_Originally [published on the Server Density
blog](https://blog.serverdensity.com/running-a-successful-beta-trickle-effect-and-phone-feedback/)_.

When you’re heavily involved with a product that you’ve been developing, you
expect that as soon as you launch it, millions of people will immediately try it
out. Unfortunately, unless you’re Google it is highly unlikely that will happen.
Nobody knows about your product and it takes a lot of effort to promote it and
sign up users. In fact, in this post I’m going to explain why it is better to
get a small number of users who love your product and then build on that.

Knowing when to release a product is difficult. The maxim “release early,
release often” certainly applies but that has to be balanced against making sure
you have a [minimum viable
product](http://venturehacks.com/articles/minimum-viable-product) and features
that work well, with a minimum number of bugs. You also need to get feedback as
early as possible to either [completely change what you are going to
do](https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2006-02-27-flickr_x.htm) or [introduce
new features you would never have thought
of](https://boxedice.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/server-density-beta-update-3-server-snapshots/) on
your own.

[Customer](http://startup-marketing.com/category/customer-development/) [driven](https://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/search/label/customer%20development) development
is central to how we develop and our server monitoring application, [Server
Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), is being built that way. We started
off with an idea of what we wanted to do based on what competitors were doing
wrong. Once we reached the basic feature-set, we launched. This is the best time
to get real feedback because the product is small enough to be able to change
yet still useful to users.

## Beta Stage 1 – Very private

My background is in software development and web hosting so I already had a
number of contacts I contacted the first day the beta launched. I sent them a
quick e-mail asking if they would be interested in trying it out. This is
important – you shouldn’t send invite codes to everyone because most won’t want
them or will just forget. You need to ask the user if they want to try it and
make a commitment to doing so once you send them a code. It won’t guarantee that
they will but we had an 84% response rate doing it this way.

Equally, the product you are asking people to test should be relevant to their
interest or job. I contacted people I knew who run web hosting companies or have
servers that could actually directly benefit from the product.

## Beta Stage 2 – Private

You now need to approach people who you don’t know. My main method for doing
this was through my followers on Twitter. I [sent out
updates](https://twitter.com/davidmytton/status/1232571135) about [how the beta
was progressing](https://twitter.com/davidmytton/status/1350137833), [what I was
working on](https://twitter.com/davidmytton/status/1296767193) and [direct,
unsubtle “server monitoring, try it out”
messages](https://twitter.com/davidmytton/status/1305856634). You need to keep
this up over a period of time because a lot of your followers will miss your
messages but you shouldn’t spam; messages should be interesting on their own and
should not be the only thing you’re posting.

Even in this stage, I asked people to contact me first and to [make a commitment
to providing feedback](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BetaTest.html).
This is the whole point of the beta so you need to be sure that those who
actually sign up are aware you’re expecting feedback. If they don’t want to,
that’s fine – they can wait until it launches publicly.

We ran this for several weeks getting detailed feedback from users who were
involved. This is the best time to build a good relationship with a small number
of users who are already linked into your product development. The best possible
outcome is users who start promoting for you. We were [lucky to have this happen
we we launched our public beta](https://twitter.com/lazzurs/status/1463107116).

It is important to invite only a small number of people at a time – the trickle
effect. If you have too many users you won’t be able to co-ordinate the feedback
(see below).

## Beta Stage 3 – Public

Opened on Monday (6th April), this is [where we are at
now](https://boxedice.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/server-density-public-beta-open/).
It was timed ready for my pitch at the [TechCrunch Pitch
Workshop](http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/03/20/geek-n-rolla-tech-startups-rock-april-21-london/) event
on Tuesday (7th April). If you are going to be at conferences or giving talks
then it is a good idea to allow people to go to your site and try it out right
away.

It is important to remember that people who sign up to an open beta probably
won’t provide feedback. This is because they’re more likely to be testing it out
to see if it’s any good and don’t actually care about helping you out. They have
no involvement with the project and no prior interact with you so why should
they? Even so, you will want to get in touch to ask them.

We’re still trying different tactics for getting users:

- [Engaging](https://twitter.com/davidmytton/status/1450690877) [with](https://twitter.com/davidmytton/status/1444132167) [people](https://twitter.com/davidmytton/status/1444122601) on
  Twitter. You can use the search to find relevant keywords and @reply to
  people who are talking about those topics. This is quite close to spamming
  but is relevant and contextual – I liken it to the Google ads based on your
  search terms. However, it is important not to overdo it and make your
  message interesting and relevant to what the person you are targeting was
  talking about. We have had signups as a result of this.
- We are running a small budget AdWords campaign for a set period of time to
  look at click throughs and conversions. This can be expensive depending upon
  your market and keywords you are bidding on and so far, has not worked out
  that well for us.
- Submit your site to [gallery](http://feedmyapp.com/) and [review
  websites](http://www.killerstartups.com/). More information about [the
  benefits of this are described here](http://www.6zap.com/blog/?p=165). We
  generated several hundred uniques from just one submission
  to [feedmyapp.com](http://feedmyapp.com/). Of course, this is less targeted
  traffic and so is less likely to result in conversions.
- Go to meetups and pitches to talk to people about your product. I gave
  talked to and gave my business card out to almost everyone at the TechCrunch
  Pitch event and then followed up with everyone via e-mail the next day.
  E-mail is most likely to be considered spam so I was careful to spend some
  time visiting each person’s website to give them some feedback on that as
  well as their pitch the day before. Mentioning my company was a single line
  at the end of the e-mail. This is a good way to build long term
  relationships so if they don’t need your product now, they will still
  remember you in the future. This has resulted in some signups and I’m going
  to be meeting up with some of the guys at the next event we’re at.
- Ask HN. If your target market is technical then [post an Ask HN
  thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/submit) on [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/) asking
  for reviews of your product. This is not something I’ve done yet but do plan
  to. [They](http://) [appear](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=553029) quite
  regularly and seem to give good feedback in the comments.

## Feedback – it’s all about phoning customers

If you don’t get feedback from users then there is no point in running the beta.
I have tried e-mail and survey based feedback in the past but for Server
Density, I have been [phoning customers
directly](http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2009/02/18/the-value-of-telephone-user-surveys/).
This has proved vastly more successful in receiving quality feedback. I start
with a couple of set questions I want to ask all users but the natural flow of
the conversation usually leads onto discussing other areas, finding out more how
the customer is actually using the product and the best bit – whether they sound
genuinely excited and interested by what you’re doing.

It is incredibly rewarding to talk to people who are using your software and
loving it! Even if you don’t get anything useful (we have from every call), it
will give you more incentive to continue working on the product.

In addition to the benefits you get as a developer or business owner, it
increases confidence in your company. People are used to dealing with faceless
corporations and call centres so having the lead developer or company founder
call you generates a level of trust. We’ve had feedback to this effect – people
telling us how unusual it is to have a company care enough to talk to users,
even when they’re not paying.

As an example, one of the first users I spoke to suggested what became
the [Server Snapshot
feature](https://boxedice.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/server-density-beta-update-3-server-snapshots/) which
was mentioned in a call I had today with a completely different user as being an
excellent feature that they were able to make use of in the last few days.

The steps I follow for each user are:

1. E-mail the customer to ask them if they would like to give us some feedback
   via telephone. I always say it only takes a few minutes and that I will call
   them. I ask them when would be convenient. If the call runs longer then
   that’s fine. Most of the calls I’ve done have been about 5-10 minutes, with
   one for half an hour.
2. Having arranged the time, I e-mail on the day just to remind and confirm.
3. I call the number they have provided at the time agreed, introduce myself
   and check to make sure it is still convenient.
4. Run through my prepared questions, taking notes and chatting to the customer
   off topic where appropriate. I try to stick to my structure but being
   flexible is important to allow the conversation to flow naturally.
5. Once finished, I send a thank you e-mail and mention a few things that were
   discussed. For example if the customer suggested a feature, I explain that
   we’ll consider it and if it is already being developed, when we expect it to
   be done.
6. I always make a note of every feature requested in our company wiki along
   with the customer who requested it so if we do implement it, I can tell the
   person who originally suggested it.

Questions I ask are:

- General impressions. This allows the user to talk about anything they like
  relevant to the product and often answers my later questions. This makes the
  call flow nicely and gives you the chance to talk about ideas and make notes
  as you’re going along.
- If relevant, ask about their specific usage of the product for example if
  they haven’t set up any alerts, why not.
- Ask what they were using before they started using Server Density. There are
  competitors that are likely to already being used so it is interesting to
  know who you’re up against. The important thing is to find out how your
  product compares to the competitor they switched from (or are using as
  well).
- Any suggestions for new features, if it wasn’t already discussed in the
  first version.
- Some statistical information about the OS / browser they use.
- Check if they want to say or ask anything else before finishing the call.

## Managing users / feedback

When you are in private beta, it is important to keep following up users to get
feedback and check how they’re doing. This is fine to do because they have
already agreed to give feedback and given their permission for you to contact
them. We usually follow up a week after signup to allow for time to use the
product.

We use Highrise to keep track of all beta users and when we need to follow up.
All communication is handled via FogBugz and notes are entered into a single
case for that feedback call. [37signals ran a case study on our use of
Highrise](http://productblog.37signals.com/products/2009/04/case-study-software-startup-uses-highrise-to-track-beta-testers.html) which
goes into more detail on this.

## In summary

Feedback is the ultimate goal. The strategy to achieving it is to have a small
number of users you manually increase over time. Keep track of all communication
and when you need to follow up with people and make sure you talk to customers
on the phone.
