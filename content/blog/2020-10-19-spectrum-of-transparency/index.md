The common theme across my recent writing on [IT
energy](https://davidmytton.blog/category/it-energy/) is the [lack of
transparency](https://davidmytton.blog/sustainability-doesnt-work-without-transparency/) and
data for accurately assessing environmental impact. Whether you are trying to
calculate [the emissions of your cloud computing
infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0837-6) or [comparing the
most sustainable
laptops,](https://davidmytton.blog/the-environmental-impact-of-buying-a-new-laptop-comparing-the-macbook-air-and-surface-laptop/) vendors
need to publish the data behind their operations and products.

When you look into who is reporting what, the surprising thing is that many
companies are already doing a lot. However, there is a wide spectrum of detail
when it comes to that transparency.

## The most transparent

In the EU, big, public companies are [legally
required](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/non-financial-reporting_en) to
publish annual non-financial statements. [Directive
2014/95/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0095) applies
to public-interest companies with more than 500 people, including listed
companies, banks, insurance companies and other specially designated
public-interest entities.

Some of these companies are doing this because they have to, but you can see
from some reports the companies that take this seriously. They make it a core
part of their operations. These are the ones that have set [Science Based
Targets](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) for emissions reductions, ideally net
zero goals, and have formal programs with clear progress towards the all
reporting requirements: environment, social responsibility, human rights,
anti-corruption and diversity.

I was impressed with the depth and scope [in Sony’s latest
report](https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/library/reports/SustainabilityReport2020_E.pdf),
which they have been publishing since 1994 (although in different formats). You
can start to get a sense of the work that goes into these reports just by
flicking through the data charts. Having an organisation-wide diagram explaining
the environmental impact of all operations is impressive:

Other good examples include [British
Airways](https://www.iairgroup.com/~/media/Files/I/IAG/EN-Non-Financial-Information-Final%202019.pdf),
which has [a net zero 2050
target](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-britain-iag-idUSKBN1WP125),
and [H&M](https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/sustainability-reporting.html),
which is top of the [Fashion Transparency Index for
2020](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/).

## The least transparent

Most companies report nothing at all. Whether it is a big gaming company
like [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/), a media site
like [Ladbible](https://www.ladbible.com/) or an ecommerce store
like [Gear4Music](https://www.gear4music.com/), these companies completely
ignore their responsibilities.

The reason the EU requires detail from the largest companies is because they are
important factors for the analysis of risk. Financial reporting helps evaluate
past performance and make a judgement about future possibilities. Investors need
information about the environmental, social and human-rights risks just as much
as they need financial information. But it is not just investors who want to
know how a company impacts the world – everyone should care about that.

Smaller, private firms arguably have fewer resources to be able to report in the
same level of depth as public companies, so they could be required to report in
less detail. But just because you are a small company does not mean you have
zero impact. [60% of
consumers](https://www.edelman.com/news-awards/two-thirds-consumers-worldwide-now-buy-beliefs) will
buy or boycott a brand based on these types of important issues, and 64% say
that brands need to make this information available before they buy. This should
all be to the benefit of the disclosing company?

## Somewhere in the middle

In-between the two extremes of the transparency spectrum, we have companies that
sit somewhere in the middle. These are the companies such
as [Boden](https://www.boden.co.uk/en-gb/sustainability) and [The White
Company](https://www.thewhitecompany.com/uk/help/ethics), who claim to care
about their corporate responsibilities, even having dedicated sections on their
website, but disclose very little of value. They’re not small companies either,
with Boden turning over almost £400m and The White Company over £200m.

Another type of company in the middle is one that fails to disclose important
metrics. For example, Greenhouse Gas emissions fall into three scopes. Scope 1
are generated directly e.g. through a diesel generator, Scope 2 are indirect
through the purchase of electricity, and Scope 3 are all other emissions, e.g.
business travel and emissions from your suppliers.

Only Scope 1 & Scope 2 are mandatory to disclose but for many companies, Scope 3
is where the majority of their emissions are. As an example, both Adidas and
Nike disclose their GHG emissions in detailed reports. Both companies produce
similar products and have extensive, global supply chains. However, Adidas does
not disclose Scope 3 whereas Nike does:

|                          | Adidas (2019) | Nike (2019) |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| Scope 1 (tCO2e)          | 6,620         | 46,714      |
| Scope 2 (Market) (tCO2e) | 21,690        | 209,065     |
| Scope 3 (tCO2e)          | ?             | 15,700,000  |

Note how 98% of Nike’s emissions come under Scope 3. It is great to see [Adidas
commit to being carbon
neutral](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/28/business/adidas-allbirds-zero-carbon-shoe/index.html) but
without measuring Scope 3, that commitment is meaningless.

Unless you run power planets or consume huge amounts of electricity directly in
facilities you own, not reporting Scope 3 emissions is simply [a way to hide the
majority of your emissions](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0837-6).

## Transparency regulation

I am generally against detailed government regulation. Free markets with
effective competition are the most efficient way to run economies. Governments
should set some rules, and enforce them, but should otherwise not engage in
active industrial strategy. Transparency should be one of those rules.

One of the problems of free markets is correctly pricing negative externalities.
Introducing more rigorous transparency requirements for the areas that are
typically considered externalities is one way to force companies to at least
measure, and eventually reduce them.

With freedom of information, the mechanisms of a democratic society (the press
and courts) apply scrutiny to the government. The same principle applies to the
private sector. When you have transparency, and consistent reporting, market
forces work better.
