Large businesses are at a disadvantage when it comes to making real change to
tackling climate change. Unless there is a clear cost benefit ([such as by
switching to cheaper, renewably generated
power](https://www.irena.org/publications/2019/May/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2018))
implementing changes which cannot be justified by a simple internal cost-benefit
analysis are difficult to build a business case for.

Energy usage is the easiest to measure. You can look at the itemised bill and
calculate exactly how much could be saved by switching to a green utility
provider. It becomes more difficult when you have to consider direct and
indirect emissions, complex multi-national supply chains and how the
environmental footprint of third party vendor operations affect your own impact.

But it is increasingly important. Consumers are noticing, and making buying
decisions based on sustainability criteria:

> Nearly half (48%) of U.S. consumers say they would definitely or probably
> change their consumption habits to reduce their impact on the environment. And
> these consumers are putting their dollars where their values are, spending
> $128.5 billion on sustainable fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) products this
> year\*. Since 2014, these influential shoppers have grown sustainable product
> sales by nearly 20%, with a compound average growth rate (CAGR) that’s four
> times larger than conventional products (3.5% vs -1.0%\*\* comparatively). By
> 2021, we expect these sustainably minded shoppers to spend up to $150 billion
> on sustainable FMCG goods an increase of $14 billion – $22 billion

So where should corporates start? Are there any quick wins that can have an
impact today?

## First step: reporting

Standards for reporting on sustainability have existed for some time. The GRI
Sustainability Reporting Standards ([GRI
Standards](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards)) were created in 1997 and
have now been adopted by 93% of the world’s largest corporations. And in the US,
the [Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reporting standards](https://ghgprotocol.org/) are
used by 9 out of 10 Fortune 500 companies.

Reporting tends to be voluntary, and the format of existing reports is usually
determined by the company itself. But the introduction of global standards is
quickly being followed by legal requirements to report this information. In the
UK, reporting on greenhouse gas emissions has been [required by all quoted
companies since 2013, and reporting of global energy use since
2019](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/measuring-and-reporting-environmental-impacts-guidance-for-businesses).

You can’t improve what you don’t measure. The GHG Standards [created the concept
of
scoping](https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/faqs/services/scope-3-indirect-carbon-emissions/) to
help determine precisely where emissions are being generated. This is important
to decide where to focus initial efforts.

- Scope 1 emissions are those most under your control e.g. emissions from
  boiler combustion or chemical processes, but are therefore likely to be the
  most difficult to change.
- Scope 2 emissions include electricity purchased by the company, where it
  might be easier to change supplier.
- Scope 3 emissions are those not directly controlled, such as use of
  purchased materials or emissions from services contracts. It is often
  assumed that these are the most difficult to mitigate, but this is actually
  the area where corporates can have the most immediate impact.

## Corporate supply and demand

Startups have an advantage when it comes to agility. The fact that they are
small means they can adopt new policies and implement changes quickly. They also
have the advantage of being able to start from scratch.

Startups are the future growth companies. If the company starts with a
sustainability mindset, it’s much easier to continue with that approach as the
new status quo, rather than try and change it in the future. [There are plenty
of ways that startups can help combat climate
change](https://davidmytton.blog/how-startups-can-help-combat-climate-change/).
But due to their size, their immediate impact is tiny. The opposite is true for
corporates.

The market mechanism is the best way to make lasting change. Incentives matter
and competition encourages changes in products and services to meet the needs of
the consumer. Corporate buyers are consumers like any other, but their large
size means they can have a big impact on what is offered in the market.

This is basic economics. Demand encourages supply. Suppliers compete to be the
best.

Anyone who has ever sold into the enterprise or been part of a vendor evaluation
process knows how buying and selling to corporates works. RFPs. Checklists of
features. Security reviews. All of these processes have built up over time to
evaluate vendors on objective criteria.

If large corporate buyers require a minimum set of product features, those
features become the baseline that all suppliers must meet in order to be
competitive. This is where corporate buyers can have an immediate impact on
climate change.

## Green procurement policies

Corporate buyers should introduce environmental requirements into their
purchasing.

There are already long lists of requirements around security, certifications,
features and functionality. If the big enterprise buyers start asking for a
minimum set of sustainability requirements for all of their new vendors, the
market will quickly adapt to ensure the vendors meet those requests.

Not only would this impact the Scope 3 emissions reporting for corporates
themselves, the changes will have a ripple effect for all the other customers
supplied by that vendor. This is particularly true for modern software as a
service. Once the vendor decides to become carbon neutral and apply their own
approach to sustainability, it applies to all of their customers with no
additional effort.

Government is leading the way in this respect – [almost all OECD countries have
an approach to green public
procurement](https://www.oecd.org/gov/public-procurement/green/).

The EU required all member states to implement the Energy Efficiency Directive
2012/27/EU on 3 June 2014 (and also has a voluntary [Green Public
Procurement](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/gpp/index_en.htm) instrument). The
US implemented its first “green” procurement policy in 1976 which introduced a
preference for recycled products and there are [now over 300 product categories
with specific environmental purchasing
criteria](https://sftool.gov/greenprocurement).

The size of govenment forces change. Initiatives such as [the UK’s “Cloud First”
procurement policy adopted in
2013](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-adopts-cloud-first-policy-for-public-sector-it) have
a real impact on what the market offers. Corporates have a similar effect, and
many are bigger than some countries. Corporate procurement polices are an
untapped area for having a major impact on climate change.

## Change is inevitable

The major advantage of introducing a new requirement for selecting
sustainability as part of the procurement process is that it requires no changes
to existing practices yet still has a major positive impact as vendors are
forced to adapt.

Corporates are ultimately going to have to adopt green practices to their entire
business or face challenges either from competitors, consumer demand, or both.
Adopting a green procurement policy is an easy change that can have an immediate
impact whilst the more difficult, long term policy changes are figured out.
