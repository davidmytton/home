We tend to talk about specific cloud vendor products, usually when there is
something new and exciting to discuss. Appealing to developers is the first
step.

It starts with hearing about the amazing new technology Google Cloud has just
productised, the newest release of an open source framework or a compelling new
AWS product you can replace an existing legacy system with.

But the longer term objective is to bring in your entire workload.

## How many products do the cloud vendors have?

As of mid-August 2017, there are over 164 individual products across 41
categories from the main 3 cloud providers. These are just how the vendor names
their portfolio on their website and each product has many sub-features which
might be considered products by themselves:

- AWS has 18 product categories with a total of 100 named products within
  them.
- Azure has 14 product categories with a total of 100 named products within
  them.
- GCP has 9 product categories with a total of 64 named products within them.

(There are no other cloud providers that matter, hence the focus on AWS, Azure
and GCP)

## Driving adoption – land and expand

In some organisations, there is a high level directive to migrate to the cloud
but most cloud adoption comes from individual developers picking a particular
cloud service they want to use.

Services are chosen either because they make achieving a particular outcome
easier, and/or because an engineer wants an excuse to try out a “cool”
technology.

Most products can be used in isolation, but once you start using one vendor then
the next time you have a problem to solve the default choice is to look at the
options from within the ecosystem you’re already inside.

Staying within the family has benefits ranging from better network latency and
lower (or free) data transfer fees to easy access to existing data stores and
the simplicity of a single bill.

This is a classic land and expand strategy. The individual products must attract
developers with a compelling use case and be entirely usable by themselves.
However, when combined with other cloud products from the same vendor, the
benefits all add up.

## What does this mean for cloud marketing?

- Appealing to developers is crucial. Good quality documentation, friendly
  APIs, easy authentication and multi-platform SDKs all promote adoption.
- Technical credibility is important. Sharing information at conferences,
  giving talks and publishing blog posts all helps to show off the cool
  technology behind the scenes. It gets people talking.
- Developer advocacy teams travelling the world, attending meetups, giving
  live demos and engaging directly with engineers.

## The end goal – 100% cloud

At Server Density, this started with [our use of Google Cloud
Bigtable](https://blog.serverdensity.com/time-series-data-opentsdb-bigtable/) but
we are almost done with a complete migration from Softlayer to Google Cloud. We
want full access to the portfolio of Container Engine, BigQuery, Compute Engine,
Cloud ML…all connected to our Bigtable instances.

The big 3 cloud vendors want to draw you in with a single product that is just
what you’re looking for, lowering the barrier to adopting the rest of their
portfolio over time. It starts with just a single product solving a very
specific use case, but the goal is for all IT spend to move to the cloud. It’s
the enterprise-wide purchase agreement all over again.
