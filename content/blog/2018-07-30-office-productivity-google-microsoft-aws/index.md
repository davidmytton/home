[One of the lessons](https://25iq.com/2018/07/28/lessons-from-elad-gil/) of
the [High Growth
Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40538194-high-growth-handbook) is
that the most successful software companies start out with a single product, but
soon shift to using their distribution advantage to offer a portfolio of
products:

> Startups tend to succeed by building a product that is so compelling and
> differentiated that it causes large number of customers to adopt it over an
> incumbent. This large customer base becomes a major asset for the company
> going forward. Products can be cross sold to these customers, and the
> company’s share of time or wallet can expand. Since focusing on product is
> what caused initial success, founders of breakout companies often think
> product development is their primary competency and asset. In reality, the
> distribution channel and customer base derived from their first product is now
> one of the biggest go-forward advantages and differentiators the company has.

This advantage is fairly clear when it comes to public cloud providers.

[When AWS first
launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Amazon_Web_Services), it
began with basic infrastructure primitives: storage (S3) and compute (EC2). Over
time, it has added a vast number of products into the ecosystem.

This is a classic enterprise model: if you buy one product in the suite, when
you need something else you will look to the vendor you already have a contract
with first. This is because it simplifies management interfaces, network
configuration, security, support, billing and legal agreements.

AWS certainly has an advantage here – it has the biggest mindshare amongst
developers. The ecosystem effects of people with the right technology experience
are compelling. Google is competing hard, but AWS is ahead when it comes to the
size of the portfolio.

Yet AWS has a weakness when it comes to the office productivity suite. This is
already a massive lead generator for Microsoft and Azure, and it could become a
big source of customers for Google too.

Microsoft has been leveraging its licensing advantage amongst the largest,
enterprise customers who use their productivity products – Office, Exchange,
Windows. For a long time, [Azure was being pushed to be licensed as part of the
deal](https://stratechery.com/2014/daily-update-facebook-changes-privacy-policy-microsoft-channel-partners-sell-azure-problem-ibm/).
If you’re already using Microsoft products, it makes sense to consider Azure
first.

Whilst Microsoft might have a good base within the enterprise, Google has a
similar foothold within the technology community. Pretty much every startup uses
G Suite for email, calendar, docs, etc. Most of these use AWS. But the
improvements in Google Cloud Platform, and [the security and identity products
in particular](https://cloud.google.com/products/#identity-and-security), are
making the G Suite to G Cloud cross-sell more compelling.

Hows does AWS compare? WorkMail and WorkDocs. Not particularly compelling
products, and products which seem to have been neglected. I don’t know anyone
using either of these. Why would you?

This is one major area that AWS is significantly behind.

The Microsoft / Azure demographic is quite different from those using AWS and
Google, but as G Suite and GCP become more tightly integrated, it will become a
big differentiator for them.
