If you’ve ever applied for a job anywhere, you probably had a terrible
experience.

Submitting an application into a black hole.

Waiting weeks without hearing anything. Maybe never hearing anything at all.

Vague instructions and trying to guess what the selection criteria are.

Delays getting an answer from early interviews.

Lack of any feedback if you get to later interviews.

More delays getting an offer…then, suddenly, time is of the essence and you must
make a decision right now!

For most candidates at most companies, this is probably familiar. How does it
make you feel about that company? They might be building awesome products, using
the latest tech and working on a problem you really want to be part of. You
start off with a great impression from their cool products, external marketing
and great reputation, only to leave the process disappointed.

[Recruiters are a waste of
time](https://davidmytton.blog/when-does-it-make-sense-to-use-a-recruiter-for-hiring-engineers/) –
not only do they do a terrible job for their clients but they usually contribute
to the reputation damage inflicted by badly run processes. But the companies
themselves are just as bad. Once a recruiter hands the process over, then they
could still run things properly.

Recruitment is odd in that it usually fails – the most common outcome is the
failure of the candidate. That’s by design. Many more people interact with the
company through the recruitment process than will ever be employed there.

So why not make them advocates? Or at least not detractors.

Even with the disappointment of not being selected for a job, the company can
still leave the candidate with a positive impression.

A well run recruitment process should always send replies quickly and keep the
candidate informed at all stages. The candidate should never have to chase for a
response. It should be run quickly, with progression to the next stage happening
over the course of days or within 1-2 weeks. Schedules sometimes don’t fit but
with people being the most crucial aspect of the success of a business, making
time for candidates should be a priority. And if a candidate dedicates time to
the process, the least you can do is let them know why they weren’t successful
in the end.

Every company uses a system to process applications. Communication should be
built in, it can even be automated at the early stages. There is no excuse.

Why? Because the candidate might become a customer. They might tell their
friends (who could be suitable candidates). They might apply for another
position in the future.

Recruitment is another opportunity to build the company brand. To do some
marketing. To enhance reputation and show off. It should be treated as such.
