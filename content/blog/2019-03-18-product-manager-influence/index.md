summary: "How can product managers get things done when they have little to no 
direct authority over the teams actually implementing the project?"

The product organisation is unusual in that it achieves its goals through
influencing other parts of the company rather than through a managerial
relationship with individuals that sit with its direct reporting line.

A typical product group will have a leader reporting into the CEO who then has
product managers reporting into them. The number and complexity of those
products will determine how deep that org chart is but the people actually doing
the implementation are usually part of another reporting group e.g. engineers
report up to the VP, Engineering (or perhaps the CTO).

This is of course a generalisation, but it’s rare to have engineers reporting
into the product manager, for example. The same applies to other aspects of the
company – marketing reports though the VP, Marketing or CMO. Sales is led by the
VP, Sales or CRO. And so on.

Despite this, the product manager is working very closely with all these areas
of the organisation. They define large parts of what the work is ([but not the
how](https://davidmytton.blog/product-managers-are-not-responsible-for-how/))
but are unlikely to be directly assigning tasks or “managing” the team they are
working with.

This means that good product managers must rely on their powers of influence and
persuasion to make a case and explain why something should be implemented. They
have no direct reporting authority or rank, so must take care to build up
respect and authority by the quality of their work.

In practical terms, this means:

- **Understanding the customer better than anyone else.** Sales might know
  best about what prospects are looking for before they become customers, and
  support might understand key pain points in product usage for existing
  customers, but it is the product manager who should have the best
  understanding of the customer as a whole, across their entire lifecycle
  using the product. Product manager activities should involve bring on sales
  calls, visiting customers on-site, participating in UX reviews, dipping into
  support tickets and chats, running feedback sessions with sales and support,
  and triaging customer feedback.
- **Understanding the market better than anyone else.** Marketing probably
  know how to generate the widest reach in the most targeted way and finance
  truly understand how margins should be optimised, but the it is the job of
  the product manager to understand why one marketing idea might be better
  than another based on an understanding of how customers consider
  alternatives, buy and then use the product. And to give finance the input
  they need about competitive pricing and operational costs. Product manager
  activities should involve collaborating on the go-to-market plan, reviewing
  funnel statistics, engaging with analysts, understanding infrastructure
  costs, testing competitor products, positioning product pricing packages
  against features and customer personas, discussing deal win/loss reasons
  with sales and understanding churn reasons.
- **Communicating across the organisation.** Communication is the biggest
  challenge in any company, and only gets more difficult as it grows. There
  are so many levels of granularity in delivering a successful product so it
  is crucial that everyone understands the long term vision and how that
  translates into each feature release. Product manager activities should
  involve discussing the strategic plan with the CEO/executive team and with
  the wider product manager group, testing out pitches with real customers
  (can you articulate how you got to where you are today, and where the
  product is going?), sending out regular product updates to customers
  (newsletters) and internal groups (changelogs), building training decks for
  sales/support, then delivering the training itself, writing up roadmaps,
  converting feedback into product specs, helping debate the prioritisation of
  key initiatives and explaining to sales/support why something is going to be
  done (or not done).

Product management truly is the job with the most cross-company influence but is
least able to rely on rank and position to derive authority. It means it is one
of the more difficult roles to start from scratch in, but has the most
opportunity to build influence and authority through results.
