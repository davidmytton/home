Amazon is the best example where owning the full delivery stack is important.
They can offer the widest selection, lowest price and fastest shipping but if
the experience of finally receiving your order is poor, that will reflect badly
on Amazon. If your order was late, lost or damaged, it doesn’t matter where the
true fault lies – Amazon are to blame. That’s why they’re now running their own
logistics end to end.

This principle applies widely and yet few seem to understand how important the
end to end customer experience is.

Meetings are a good example where there is an incentive to automate out the
hassle. Going back and forth to find a day and time that works for two people is
difficult. Timezones. Locations. Changing schedules. And it seems to get
exponentially difficult the more participants there are.

Proposed solutions range
from [AI](https://x.ai/) [assistants](https://calendar.help/) through
to [selecting time slots from a web calendar](https://calendly.com/). A lot of
“busy” people use human assistants as well. But I’ve always found these
unsatisfactory. AI assistants have made “mistakes” which are embarrassing to
correct. Sending people to a link seems impersonal and handing it off to an
assistant is only as good as that assistant – if they’re slow to reply or make
errors, the whole process becomes frustrating. For some this might not matter
much, but if meetings are a core part of how you do business e.g. investors, a
poor experience might mean you lose deals.

The same principle applies to software. [Onboarding customers to
SaaS](https://blog.chartmogul.com/a-guide-to-saas-customer-onboarding/) is a
critical step in [ensuring new customers successfully
deploy](https://davidmytton.blog/what-is-the-difference-between-customer-success-and-account-management/),
which is key to preventing churn. [Onboarding is well
understood](https://www.saastr.com/best-practices-in-customer-success/) but
there is much more to the software experience, particularly for developers.
Documentation, API references and programming libraries are all part of the
“first run” experience. [MongoDB is one of the most successful examples of
this](https://blog.jsr.wtf/the-million-dollar-minute/).

Mapping out the full delivery stack and having someone own the full end to end
experience is the only way to keep quality high. Over time, the ownership and
responsibility of each component will be delegated to different people and
teams. Decisions will be made that make sense in isolation but affect the
overall flow, and they won’t be spotted unless someone regularly runs through it
all. Even the CEO should regularly test their product, [as Bill Gates found in
2003](https://sriramk.com/memos/billgates-moviemaker.pdf).
