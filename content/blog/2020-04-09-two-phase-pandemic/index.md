I have not written directly about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic because I don’t
have any relevant expertise to add. Enough people are writing about this so I am
following a small number of sources to try and keep the noise down.

- [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/), particularly his interviews,
  providing good coverage from a tech perspective.
- [Imperial College
  reports](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/) provide
  excellent epidemiological modelling and are informing UK government policy.
  It was [Report 4 on Feb
  10](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-4-severity-of-covid-19/) about
  the fatality rates that changed my mind about how serious this was going to
  be. On 2nd Feb I had booked a June flight
  to [Japan](https://davidmytton.blog/japan/), but after reading this report
  decided to hold off any further planning to see how things developed. That
  trip has now been postponed.
- [Niall Ferguson](https://twitter.com/nfergus) writes in various outlets and
  usually tweets his articles, providing an essential economic historical
  perspective. [His Feb 2 column in The
  Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-deadliest-virus-we-face-is-complacency-wsp7xdr7s) alerted
  me to the potential of what was happening, although I did not yet appreciate
  the severity. [A recent policy seminar with
  him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyOvYZfB7JA) provided a useful
  historical perspective.
- [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) of Y Combinator is tweeting useful
  information, mostly from medical and epidemiological sources.
- [Yuan Yang](https://twitter.com/YuanfenYang), the Beijing correspondent for
  the FT is providing an essential perspective from within China.
- I am not following daily on Twitter but [Tim
  Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2020/02/14/some-thoughts-on-coronaviruses-and-seatbelts/) was
  also an early signal for me as the pandemic was ramping up in Feb. [Sam
  Harris](https://samharris.org/subscriber-extras/190-respond-coronavirus/) came
  a bit later via his podcast in March.

I am also watching the daily UK Government press conferences, which are useful
for keeping up to date with how the UK is dealing with things. Staying glued to
the news is not helpful, so I am trying to go about everything else in as normal
a manner as possible, only checking the above sources [once or twice a
day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lECIsRif10).

I use [writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65U5byDZ55M), and [this
blog](https://davidmytton.blog/writing-as-a-core-company-value/), to develop my
understanding of topics. The best way for me to work through an issue is by
writing, so this post is about how I am thinking about the pandemic in two
phases: medical and economic.

There are a lot of questions and I have no answers. Nobody knows what is going
to happen next – uncertainty is one of the biggest challenges and models are
only a simplification of reality. Whether it is the true number of infections or
what is going to happen to major industries, the lack of predictability makes it
even more difficult. That said, I have found thinking in two phases useful to
understand our current situation.

## Phase 1: Medical

We are currently in this phase. The goal is to “[flatten the
curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/)” through social distancing, thereby
protecting the health service to allow it to treat as many people as possible. A
huge part of this is staying at home, which is what has caused the serious
economic damage. Governments are trying to simulate the economy by paying
people’s wages (or equivalent, through social security) so that we can get
through this phase. In this phase the economic cost is rightly being ignored –
the priority is to get through this phase as best we can.

- How many cases are there? What is the true fatality rate? How many people
  are asymptomatic? How does this change based on demographic?
- How does transmission work? How do we know if workers should self-isolate or
  if they can return to work? [How will the antibody testing
  work?](https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/Article/2020-04-05-trouble-in-testing-land) Why
  can’t we test more people? What measures are effective at prevention? Are
  people immune once they have had it?
- How is the health system coping now? How will it cope over the coming weeks?
  What do health workers need to be effective?
- Do we need to introduce stricter measures? How long can people keep this up?
  What happens as the weather gets nicer?
- How do people deal with isolation? What is the mental health impact? How can
  healthy people help?
- [When can we lift the social distancing
  measures?](https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2020/04/the-question-isnt-whether-or-not-to-end-the-lockdown-its-when-and-how-to-do-it-can-this-johnson-deprived-government-now-rise-to-the-challenge.html) [How
  do we gradually allow people back to normal
  activities?](https://www.ft.com/content/1fa5ae87-b3b6-4708-b9c5-58d2077b8d95) Who
  gets priority to return to work first? When is it safe for the most
  vulnerable to go out again? How do we know who has immunity and who doesn’t?
- When will there be a vaccine? How do we deliver it to the global population?
  Who gets it first and how do we know who has had it and who can go back to
  work?
- [How do we safely roll back the measures introduced in this
  phase?](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/04/04/1586015208000/Imperial-s-Neil-Ferguson---We-don-t-have-a-clear-exit-strategy-/) What
  about students and teaching? Are qualifications considered as valid? What
  about people brought into the frontline who are not technically qualified
  e.g. final-year medical students?
- [Will there be a second
  wave?](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:42638988)
- How do we prepare better for the next pandemic?

This phase will be short-term and will have an end.

## Phase 2: Economic

At some point, the medical phase will end. Whether through a vaccine or
exhausting transmission through isolation and/or herd immunity, COVID-19 cases
will start to decline. The economic phase started when social distancing was
introduced as business as usual came to an end, so it runs in parallel behind
the scenes, but once the medical phase ends (or reduces) then phase 2 really
starts.

- How quickly can people return to work? How [quickly does consumer demand
  return?](https://www.ft.com/content/b427db58-77e6-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03) Will
  it return to the same levels? How soon? Do industries bounce back right
  away?
- [What happens to the people who have lost jobs](https://www.layoffs.tech/)?
  Is it permanent? What do they do next? Can they retrain? How will the new
  social security measures cover them and for how long?
- Is there a new mortgage crisis because people who previously had secure jobs
  lost them and can no longer pay their mortgages? Will properties be
  repossessed because landlords lost their income from people who cannot pay
  rent? [How does that affect house
  prices?](https://www.ft.com/content/e82ea7eb-4d91-4f70-b466-c31eac783907)
- How are pension funds affected? Will people coming up to retirement have
  less money than they were expecting?
- [Does this change how we think about climate
  change?](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/26/what-the-coronavirus-curve-teaches-us-about-climate-change-148318)
- [How does the oil shock interact with the coronavirus
  shutdown?](https://www.iea.org/articles/the-global-oil-industry-is-experiencing-shock-like-no-other-in-its-history)
- [Is this a major shock that changes things in unknown ways or does it
  accelerate existing
  trends?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/06/coronavirus-is-accelerating-history-past-the-breaking-point/)
- [What was already changing that will now be the
  norm](https://twitter.com/nfergus/status/1247508641097236485) e.g. remote
  working or political nationalism, telemedicine? What changes become
  permanent e.g. do we need a big office, is everything in the cloud, what
  level of social security is right for the government to offer?
- How do we pay for the costs? Are taxes changed? Does it matter if we have
  such a high national debt? If there is huge unemployment, where does the
  government find revenues to pay for everything?

This phase will have an unknown duration. We don’t know the long term
implications, what “normal” will look like or when we will return to it.
Although the medical phase has terrible human cost, the economic phase may well
cause even greater hardship over a longer period of time.

## Thinking in phases

The medical phase is what everyone is thinking about now because it impacts
people personally. Illness and death are horrible.

It’s important to focus on how to react now (as [an
individual](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus) or [a
company](https://steveblank.com/2020/04/01/the-ceo-playbook-for-keeping-your-company-alive/)),
but just as important to think about how to deal with the long term
impact. [That’s where the economic considerations come
in](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196514/the-economic-impact-coronavirus-analysis-from/).
It’s too simplistic to dismiss “the economy” as something impacting the wealthy
few – the risk of lasting harm is present for both phases, just in different
forms. Both are important at the right time.

For now, these are all open questions.
