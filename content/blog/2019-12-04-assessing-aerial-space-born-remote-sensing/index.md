The history of remote sensing goes back as far as 1936 when the combination of
photography and aviation provided a new method of studying urban
environments (Furgate, Tarnavsky & Stow, 2010). Aerial remote sensing in the
form of photography from aircraft was of great use during World War Two (St.
Joseph, 1945) but the first major post-war application was in archaeology (St.
Joseph, 1945).

Up to the 1970s, remote sensing primarily involved low resolution film-based
systems and the limited availability of imagery constrained applications mainly
to urban planning (Furgate, Tarnavsky & Stow, 2010). It was not until the launch
of the Landsat-1 satellite in 1972 (NASA, 2019a) that remote sensing began to
develop more rapidly.

Remote sensing was brought into mainstream awareness by the recommendations in
Our Common Future (Brundtland et al., 1987). Since then, remote sensing has
become a crucial tool to allow environmental assessment and provide data
essential to achieving sustainability goals. Perhaps the most widely publicly
discussed example of this is imagery showing damage to the Amazon
rainforest (Renó et al., 2011) which would not have been possible without remote
sensing.

Focusing on the era since Landsat-1, this essay will consider the development
and application of space borne remote sensing techniques alongside aerial
applications. The more recent development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
will also be examined.

## A Contemporary History of Applications

Since 1972, space borne sources of remote sensing data have been used for a wide
range of applications beginning with the formal adoption of satellite data by
the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology in 1974 (Sivakumar et al., 2004).

Landsat has the longest history but there are other major imaging satellites
from organisations around the world such as the French SPOT satellites, Indian
Remote Sensing System and QuickBird, operated by the private firm Digital
Globe (Furgate, Tarnavsky & Stow, 2010).

Although satellite data can be used alone, it is often combined with ground or
aerial observations either to provide additional data that cannot be collected
from space (e.g. due to resolution limitations) or to calibrate results (Marx,
McFarlane & Alzahrani, 2017).

Data collected from aircraft has long complemented satellite data but in the
last decade UAV technology has become available (Singh & Frazier, 2018). The
last 5 years has seen a boom in the use of UAVs for terrestrial applications,
particularly in agriculture, geomorphology and forestry (Singh & Frazier, 2018).
This suggests that decreasing technology costs are associated with an increase
in adoption of remote sensing data. Starting with the release of Landsat data
for free in 2008 (USGS, 2008), technology improvements bring associated cost
decreases thereby allowing studies to be conducted which would have been
expensive or impossible in the past.

Whether it is generating public awareness of the extent of deforestation in the
Amazon rainforest (Renó et al., 2011), examining urban deforestation and
regrowth (Gong et al., 2013) or monitoring growth of desert cities (Yagoub,
2004), we can expect the application of remote sensing to continue to increase
as technology becomes more accessible.

The remainder of this essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of
these technologies, and how they are being used together.

## Space borne sources: advantages and disadvantages

As the first generally available source of remote sensing data, Landsat has the
unique advantage of historical records going back to 1972 for a range of sensor
types and bands (NASA, 2019d). However, this does not necessarily mean that a
continuous dataset is available – there are gaps in records caused by a variety
of issues including data loss and cloud cover (Goward et al., 2006). A good
example of where this has caused problems is Marx, McFarlane & Alzahrani
(2017) where they were unable to obtain any data for 1991, 1994, 1995 and 2000
due to cloud cover, and only partial images for 1987, 1993 and 1996. Given they
were attempting to study a 30-year period, these limitations have real effects
on long term studies.

In 2003, Landsat-7 suffered a sensor failure which resulted in a 6-week record
gap and up to 25% of data for all future captures being unavailable (NASA,
2019b). Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 (NASA, 2019c) which restored complete
imaging, but the 10-year gap shows the long lead time required to deploy new
systems and technologies or recover from sensor failure.

That considered, when operating normally a major advantage of satellite imagery
is regular revisit frequency. No additional effort is required to get a
continuous timeline of sensor data from regions around the globe. This has
proven crucial in disaster relief efforts to compare damage to the pre-disaster
state (Kakooei & Baleghi, 2017).

However, revisit frequency is different for each satellite platform and there is
no guarantee that weather conditions will allow successful data capture (Jay et
al., 2019). This limits the usefulness of satellite data in applications such as
analysing rice cultivation where timeliness is crucial (Inoue et al., 2012;
Launay & Guerif, 2005).

This means that whilst satellites have advantages in terms of their theoretical
ability to continuously collect data from variety of sensors across a large
geographical area, their operation cannot be relied upon. Depending on the data
required, such problems can be mitigated by combining data from aerial sources.

## Aerial sources: advantages and disadvantages

One of the major advantages of aerial data is the speed of access to data –
images can often be made available in less than an hour when UAVs are
involved (Kakooei & Baleghi, 2017). However, due to the size of the data and
depending on how the data is analysed, processing can take longer than satellite
data (Ruwaimana et al., 2018), especially with time needed to stitch the imagery
together in a mosaic (Moran, Inoue & Barnes, 1997).

Unlike satellites which tend to have fewer variables and are calibrated on
deployment, aerial conditions such as altitude and atmospheric conditions
require careful ongoing calibration (Moran, Inoue & Barnes, 1997). Indeed,
Landsat-7 acts as an in-orbit standard for calibration of other systems (NASA,
2019) which shows the stability that satellite data offers.

A major challenge with aerial data has been the low resolution, but UAVs are now
able to offer sub-centimetre pixel resolutions (Jay et al., 2019). This is
important because features of interest can be distributed across multiple pixels
or within a single pixel, both of which cause challenges in analysis (Furgate,
Tarnavsky & Stow, 2010). Certain field applications, such as evaluating crop
breeds, require resolutions higher than satellites can offer (Sankaran et al.,
2015) and so UAVs have opened a new area of remote sensing which was previously
impossible.

Unlike satellites which have a large range of sensors, researchers must choose
from different types of UAVs each with different characteristics. Power source
and maximum payload size determine which sensors are available (Sankaran et al.,
2015) but costs also vary, ranging from $1,000 to $100,000 (Singh & Frazier,
2018).

Having more choice allows researchers to prioritise what is important to their
study. Contrasted to free data available from Landsat, budgetary decisions are
now part of the equation, rather than assuming access to the best data
available. This means factors such as cost, access to the study area and control
over the data can be deciding factors at the expense of overall
accuracy (Kavoosi et al., 2018).

Although it introduces more complexity, choice is having a positive effect, as
shown by the increase in the numbers of studies published using data from
UAVs (Singh & Frazier, 2018).

## Combining aerial and space borne sources

Logistical challenges are providing opportunities to combine multiple sources of
remote sensing imagery. For example, GPS signals being blocked by dense forest
canopy or lack of road infrastructure make ground observations difficult (Marx,
McFarlane & Alzahrani, 2017), but this can now be solved with aerial imaging.
Just as comparisons of urban growth used to be limited by cost and processing
challenges (Masek, Lindsay & Goward, 2000), technology improvements are allowing
new applications to emerge at lower cost.

Novel combinations of both sources of sensor data are being found. These range
from increasing the level of detail in existing forest monitoring (Dash, Pearse
& Watt, 2018) or entirely new applications in areas such as disaster relief,
where overhead imagery is being combined with oblique angles to create 3D
representations of damaged buildings (Kakooei & Baleghi, 2017).

UAVs are being suggested as alternatives to what would previously have been
achieved using fieldwork (Kattenborn et al., 2019). In Renó et al. (2011),
satellite imagery was augmented using field observations – human interviews and
photography, including using aircraft to survey the edges of the target site.
The paper does not explain the decision to use aerial photography outside the
central area but assuming this was because of the logistical challenges, the
fieldwork could now be achieved at lower cost using UAVs instead.

That said, it is not always the case that more accurate data is automatically
better. Existing methods are unable to deal with newer, very high-resolution
data (X. Zhang et al., 2017) but techniques are starting to be developed (Jay et
al., 2017; Jay et al., 2019) to take advantage of higher levels of accuracy.

UAVs have been the subject of much hype which has not been matched by
deployment (Freeman & Freeland, 2015). This is perhaps due to how sales and
marketing efforts have focused on commercial agriculture rather than academic
research. UAV manufacturers want to maximise revenue and agriculture is a
business they can sell to for a profit. Academic research is not. Although they
may not be highly profitable, academics often have time and motivation to
develop new analysis techniques not possible within the constraints of
commercial agriculture. Manufacturers could therefore see academia as a
collaboration partner rather than as a commercial customer. More research is
needed here to understand how technologies are adopted in each sector. To expand
sales, it has been suggested that more practical analysis methods are needed for
commercial demand to increase (Hunt & Daughtry, 2018).

Another challenge is the remaining uncertainties around the legality of UAVs. 33
countries currently have some form of regulations (The Drone Info, 2019) but
this varies by location. Some countries allow hobbyist usage, some ban drones
altogether and all place restrictions on commercial usage (Cracknell, 2017).

The variety of options and multiple considerations of payload capacity, battery
size and sensor types when selecting systems contrasts with the freely available
repository of satellite imaging. Users now need to think about the options and
what that means for cost. This means that whilst studies such as Sankaran et al.
(2015) are useful in comparing technical parameters, they miss crucial cost
calculations. Studies such as Singh & Frazier (2018) are more useful in that
regard.

## Conclusions

Over 80 years since the first use of remote sensing data, the field has
experienced several distinct stages. Starting with aerial photographic data, the
launch of Landsat-1 in 1972 was a turning point for global earth observation.
This was further catalysed by making the data free in 2008. Satellites have been
a major source of remote sensing data for some time but the last decade has seen
an increase in aerial observations with the introduction of accurate and
affordable UAV systems.

Very high-resolution data can be collected in short timeframes with
UAVs (Kakooei & Baleghi, 2017) and new methods of processing that data are being
developed (Jay et al., 2017; Jay et al., 2019). From freely available to
high-resolution commercial options (Marx, McFarlane & Alzahrani, 2017), a
variety of satellite data exist to complement aerial and UAV data (Singh &
Frazier, 2018).From a single satellite and aircraft photography in 1972 to a
range of space borne and aerial options in 2019, such variety allows users to
determine their own trade-offs, allowing them to choose the sources of data that
make sense for their requirements. That this has resulted in an increase in
studies published (Singh & Frazier, 2018) should not be a surprise. We should
expect more to follow in future.
