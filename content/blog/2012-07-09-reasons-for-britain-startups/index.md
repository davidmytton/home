All around the world, governments are spending time and money to figure out the
best way to attract the attention of entrepreneurs. New startups are a great way
to stimulate the economy because they are seen as innovative and exciting,
create new jobs and are in a unique position to generate real value just from an
idea. Over the last five years, the British Government has announced changes in
every annual budget to help nurture the growing ecosystem that had already
started to establish itself organically in the United Kingdom. In my opinion,
the effect of this has been to make Britain the best place to start a new
business in 2012. Here's why:

## 1) The barriers to starting a company have been falling

Over the last 10 years I have been involved in the creation of five businesses
in the UK, either as a sole founder or part of the founding team. In 2001, when
I was 14, I did freelance programming in between schoolwork and formed my first
company from my bedroom in Birmingham, England just a few years later. Since
then, the regulatory and legal requirements behind exploring commercial ventures
have actually become easier here. Whether that is registering as self employed
and filling out a tax return through the U.K.'s color-coded online system, or
incorporating a company in about an hour for £14, the barriers to getting
started have been steadily getting lower.

## 2) The British tax man is dealing with startups more intelligently

Britain's tax authorities have become smarter about their understanding of how
businesses begin, (often unprofitably) in the early years. Now in it’s third
year, my current startup has been able to claim real cash back on R&D expenses
which can include the salaries of my 10 employees because they are all
engineers; a benefit which will switch to tax credits as we hit break-even.

## 3) A variety of helpful financial schemes

The British government provides several financial schemes that offer significant
tax benefits not just to smart investors who can afford expensive tax advice,
but also to the founders and even employees of companies. If you sell your
company, you can claim up to £10 million
of [Entrepreneurs](http://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs/) Relief and investors
can claim up to £150,000 in tax credits on their investments each year. Joining
an early stage startup is a risky move for individuals and they are often
incentivised with stock options. Employee share schemes can be set up to allow
these to be cashed out under capital gains tax at lower rates of around 20%
compared to income tax of up to 40%. Many of these benefits have only existed
since 2008 and each year the thresholds have been bumped up - for example
Entrepreneurs Relief was just £1 million in 2008, increased to £5 million in
2010 and following changes in 2011 now sits at a limit of £10 million.

## 4) The benefits are not just limited to British citizens  

Anyone resident in the European Economic Area can relocate to Britain, but from
last year, a new category of visa was created to allow anyone from anywhere in
the world to enter the UK and establish a company, so long as they have £50,000
of UK-based investment. This follows a trend set by other countries also trying
to encourage immigrant founders. Chile leads the way by paying you up to $40,000
to move there, with no inward investment requirements. Singapore and Ireland
have similar schemes as the UK, which all need a certain level of investment to
qualify. Somewhat surprisingly, the US lags well behind with fairly stiff
requirements, such as already having $1 million minimum investment. But that is
looking to change with the
Startup [Visa](https://www.forbes.com/companies/visa/) [V +0%](https://www.forbes.com/companies/visa/) Act
which is supported by big names such as [Fred
Wilson](http://www.forbes.com/profile/fred-wilson/)of New York’s Union Square
Ventures and Paul Graham from Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley based startup
incubator. However, it is somewhat telling that this movement came from the
grassroots level back in 2009, rather than being instigated by the government
itself, and still has to pass through the House and Senate.

## 5) The rise of Seedcamp and government support

The difficulties involved with moving to America to start a company as an
immigrant has sparked the growth of incubator programs outside of the US with
direct access to hundreds of well-connected, local mentors. Seedcamp, perhaps
the biggest one outside of the U.S. and an investor in my company, Server
Density, runs its program throughout Europe and has recently started to branch
out further east, into Africa and even on the East and West Coast of the United
States. Yet the main Seedcamp Week event, which all the other events feed into,
is still run in London, where Seedcamp is based. Recognizing the importance of
London, UK Trade and Investment, part of the British Government, established
the [Tech City Investment Organization](http://www.techcityuk.com/) in March
2011, amid a lot of noise from the government about East London being the place
to be for tech companies. Whilst I don’t agree that just a single area of the
city should receive all the attention -- it should really be about promoting the
whole city, if not the country -- it highlights another way the government is
trying to encourage the ecosystem through involvement of high-profile companies
like Cisco, Intel and Google and by offering incentives to be based there.

The United States has been a great place to run a company for a long time but
now, the scene has been set for Britain to really show off the kind of companies
that can be created here -- from well known successes like Last.fm (acquired by
CBS), Message Labs (acquired by Symantec) and Tweetdeck (acquired by Twitter) to
fast growing startups like Mind Candy (behind Moshi Monsters), Red Gate Software
and Spotify. The tech industry is one of the few that has been mostly immune to
recession, explaining why governments are focusing so much on it, but you don’t
have to be in tech to take advantage of running your company in what I see as
the best place to be: the UK.
