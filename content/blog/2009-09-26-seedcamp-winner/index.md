_Originally [published on the Server Density
blog](https://blog.serverdensity.com/seedcamp-2009-winner/)._

As you may have read in the tech media yesterday ([The
Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/sep/25/seedcamp-winners-2009), [TechCrunch](http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/09/25/seedcamp-announces-its-six-winners-for-2009/)),
Boxed Ice was one of [6 winners of Seedcamp Week
2009](http://blog.seedcamp.com/2009/09/and-winners-areseedcamp-congratulates.html).

> Seedcamp Week is an intensive week-long event held in London every September
> and is targeted at young entrepreneurs from across EMEA. The aim of this week
> is to collapse the time it takes startups to make and develop these critical
> relationships from months to a week and establish an unrivaled foundation on
> which the business can be built. At the end of the week Seedcamp will make the
> funding decision to invest up to €50K each in 5 teams for a small equity stake
> (5%-10%).

Even without winning, we have already gained immensely useful advice and
contacts to help continue growing the business providing not only our hosted
server monitoring tool, [Server Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), but
with a vision of having a number of products in a similar area, much
like [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/) and [Fog Creek
Software](https://www.fogcreek.com/).

We’re also excited to be involved with the Seedcamp network alongside the other
5
winners: [Brainient](http://www.brainient.com/), [Codility](http://codility.com/), [Erply](http://www.erply.ch/), [Patients
Know
Best](http://www.patientsknowbest.com/) and [Talasim](http://www.talasim.com/).

We recently added a quick Feedback link into the menu bar of the Server Density
interface so you can easily send us your suggestions for the service, but we
also have a number of exciting releases planned for the coming weeks. Feel free
to [get in touch](https://www.serverdensity.com/contact/) if you have any
questions!
