[One of the key lessons I
learned](https://davidmytton.blog/3-lessons-from-9-years-of-startups/) when I
was CEO was to hire more experienced people, sooner, and delegate key decisions
to their expertise. However, there are many things which need to be decided
quickly or with the authority of “the boss”. Whether these are high level
strategy, having someone to take ultimate responsibility or just to come to a
final decision, this seems like something which can only be decided by a single
person.

That means that I’ve always found it odd when I hear about a company having two
co-CEOs. Startups are not democracies and someone needs to be responsible for
everything that happens.

In the early days of a startup, there are many decisions. Questions about
culture, who to hire, whether to seek investment and how much, [how
communication should
work](https://davidmytton.blog/communication-inside-startups-what-and-how/) and
even the original product vision.

In some contexts, consensus decision-making can work, as can deliberation or
committee, but as we know from government it is also notoriously slow and
laborious. It might produce a politically optimum outcome for a broad
constituency of national views, but is that the right basis for startup
decision-making?

## Which successful companies have co-CEOs?

Very few high growth startups have two CEOs. It often starts out as a way to
make the early founders feel better rather than decide on one leader, but to me
it just sounds like indecision. Roles need to be divided but the key decisions
need to be made by one person.

But there are counter-examples. Oracle, SAP and Atlassian currently have
co-CEOs, with Atlassian having this structure from the beginning. Despite this,
it seems that [investors are
skeptical](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-having-two-ceos-good-idea-isnt-caroline-fairchild/) of [such
arrangements](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/297835). What happens if the
two people don’t agree? Who do investors work with? How does it work with board
voting arrangements? Who do the key executives actually report to?

Founding a company is difficult but that is why [the most successful companies
have multiple co-founders](http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html). They
support each other and provide a forum for difficult discussions. Having two
people with equal power and authority makes things difficult for everyone.

Even in the Roman Republic (509 to 27 BC), which had two
elected [consuls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul) serving together
as the highest level of office. They shared “imperium” over the whole of Rome
and its provinces, rotating on a monthly basis. This avoided conflicts because
only one consul was actually governing each month, but the other consul still
had a veto power over the other. A great example of practicality and safeguards
(until the end of the Republic, of course).

## Academic literature on two co-CEOs

A 2011 study – [It Takes Two: The Incidence and Effectiveness of Co‐CEOs.
Financial Review, 46](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6288.2011.00305.x) – looked
at 111 US public companies with two co-CEOs. It found the following interesting
results from the data:

- Most co-CEO arrangements happen as a result of M&A. The buyer and seller
  CEOs combine forces in the new company.
- Having two CEOs has advantages in allowing the combination of complementary
  skills in a role that often has to oversee a wide range of areas,
  particularly if there are multiple locations or timezones that require
  senior leadership representation. However, I’m unsure why this couldn’t be
  covered by a senior executive team and video conferencing. Leaders are not
  expected to be experts in everything they run, they’re expecting to be
  experts in running teams of experts.
- Several sources were cited ([Mintzberg
  (1989)](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F017084069001100414), [Hackman
  (2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?hl=en&publication_year=2002&author=J.R.+Hackman&title=Groups+that+Work+%28and+those+that+don%E2%80%99t%29%3A+Creating+Conditions+for+Effective+Teamwork) and [Alvarez
  and Svejenova
  (2005)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/sharing-executive-power/DA811CE16C584F7CCC2E86B4E536995B)) which
  suggest that coordination problems and interpersonal conflicts are common in
  co-CEO arrangements due to strong egos. Exploring this was one of the goals
  of the study and they actually found that co-CEO arrangements last for about
  4.5 years, the same as single CEOs. This suggests that such arrangements are
  just as stable.
- Co-CEOs receive significantly less incentive compensation than individual
  CEOs.
- Firm value is affected positively. Announcements of co-CEO appointments are
  usually met with a positive market reaction and the subsequent market to
  book (M/B) value of the company increases over time with co-CEOs.
- Co-CEO arrangements resulted in lower effort from CEOs and suggested that
  CEOs preferred to be solitary rather than work together ([Stein
  (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1086/261524), [Aghion and Tirole
  (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1086/262063), and [Almazan and Suarez
  (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1540-6261.00536)).

However, the study specifically says that this is not an argument for appointing
co-CEOs. There is correlation but not necessarily causation:

> our findings regarding corporate value do not imply that more firms should
> adopt a shared leadership structure. We base our valuation analysis on
> propensity score matched samples and therefore compare the firm’s M/B with
> co‐CEO leadership to the unobserved M/B that would have occurred with a
> solitary CEO. Improvements in M/Bs only show that firms with shared leadership
> improved their valuation. Our results do not imply that any firm could appoint
> co‐CEOs and enjoy higher value.

## Conclusions

Only 15% of the companies in the 2011 survey had founders as as co-CEOs. This is
the same trend we see with the tech company examples above – Oracle and SAP
which supports the notion that older, established public companies might run
fine with co-CEOs but does not say anything specific about startups.

Atlassian seems to be the only high growth, tech company that has successfully
started, grown and gone public with a co-CEO model, and [it is not the only
thing it has done
differently](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-18/this-5-billion-software-company-has-no-sales-staff).
It is therefore an outlier and its model [should not be
copied](https://a16z.com/2017/05/26/hiring-sales-why-what/).

Public companies are (and should be) run quite differently from new startups,
usually because they have [hired CEOs that approach things very differently from
founder
CEOs](https://kellblog.com/2019/10/13/whose-company-is-it-anyway-differences-between-founders-and-hired-ceos/).
My experience suggests that startups need a small, core (mostly technical) team
that have clearly defined roles and are working together towards a single goal.
As the company grows, decision making is delegated [based on
outcomes](https://www.producttalk.org/2019/10/managing-outcomes/) to an
experienced team led by a single CEO.

Having two co-CEOs for a startup does not work.
