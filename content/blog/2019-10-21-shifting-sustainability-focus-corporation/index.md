There is too much focus on the individual when it comes to sustainability and
being environmentally friendly.

Walk, take public transport, turn the lights off, buy less meat. These are all
good ideas if you want to do them, but the idea of the sustainable individual
has become an ethical fetish. It’s the environmentalist equivalent of virtue
signalling and has [basically
zero](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1469540507086422) real [impact on the
problem](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1469540517717782).

There are many reasons for focusing on individual action. It is easy for
policy-makers to pass the responsibility onto the individual and the media loves
to run articles on the top 10 ways to eat/shop/travel sustainably. It makes us
feel good that we’re doing something. Unfortunately, it’s much more nuanced than
that.

Nothing has zero environmental impact and understanding the true impact of your
decisions is incredibly difficult. [Local produce may not necessarily have lower
emissions than
imported](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7679.2009.00445.x). [Organic cotton is
the worst alternative to plastic
bags](https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2018/02/978-87-93614-73-4.pdf). [Some
electricity providers only buy certificates for renewable
generation](https://www.ft.com/content/5db43966-e064-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc) somewhere
else rather than actually buying from renewable suppliers.

It’s very difficult for consumers to make the right choice and making the wrong
choice can cause more damage than doing nothing.

## Starting with the greatest impact

However, this is not an argument for doing nothing. Consumer choice ultimately
drives suppliers to modify their approaches and consumers are already making
decisions based on what they perceive to be green credentials. The buyer
intention is there. This is shown by the success of programs such as Fairtrade
and Soil Association labelling and [the rise of
“buycotting”](https://www.worldcat.org/title/political-consumerism-global-responsibility-in-action/oclc/1061809489&referer=brief_results) where
consumers direct their purchases to brands they perceive to have better green
credentials. Individual actions do add up over time. It just takes a long time.

Consumers will eventually have to change some behaviour, and there are
challenges that individuals will each need to face (such as shifting home
heating sources away from gas). But it is not where the biggest impact will come
from in the shortest timespan. [The willingness for consumers to favour
sustainable companies is a global
trend](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2018/the-education-of-the-sustainable-mindset/#consumers-demand-sustainability) that
offers major opportunities for differentiation that can have a rapid impact.

A great example of the huge power of a smaller number of corporate actors can
seen in electricity generation in the UK. [Renewable energy generation grew from
5% of all electricity generation in 2008 to 35% in
2018](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/uknaturalcapitalaccounts/2019).
What did individual consumers do to benefit from this? Nothing.

Another example is the use of Google search. Despite my criticism of their
stance on privacy (I use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead), most
people search using Google. [Google has been running its infrastructure on 100%
renewable energy since
2017](https://sustainability.google/projects/announcement-100/), again with no
effort from consumers.

## What does this mean for governments?

Governments tend to be good at communicating broad messages. By now, everyone
has probably heard that it’s a [climate
emergency](https://climateemergencydeclaration.org/) but what that means to
individuals does not match with their general understanding of the word
“emergency”.

> Government has presented climate change as a potential catastrophe … Yet its
> statements about solutions, and its actual policies, do not match up to the
> story it tells…Mixed messages are highly damaging to public understanding,
> trust and sense of personal capacity to act

Focusing on individual behaviour is difficult due to how social psychology
works. Unless almost everyone is doing it, there’s a huge pressure to conform.

> The psychological tendency to discount longer-term costs and benefits makes it
> more likely that actions for the climate will remain lower down the list of

There is a huge inertia to change which must eventually be overcome but is not
where the greatest impact can be achieved today.

This all means that government focus on individual behaviour is misplaced if
they want to push the greatest change in the shortest possible time. Instead, it
is better to adopt an approach of changing consumer behaviour by proxy – work
with the major corporations and suppliers to accelerate (and require) their move
to sustainable practices. Not only will consumers benefit from those
environmental improvements with no effort on their part, seeing large companies
take a public stand will have a positive impact on motivating their own
behaviour to act.

## What can companies do to help the environment?

New startups have an advantage because they can build a sustainable approach
into their organisation from the beginning. [What startups can do to fight
climate
change](https://davidmytton.blog/how-startups-can-help-combat-climate-change/) is
important, but suffers from the same problem as individuals – they’re too small
to make any meaningful impact right now. They should still do it because they
are the large companies of the future, but the focus right now needs to be on
much larger corporates.

A good place to start is to consider what other large companies are doing.
Apple, Microsoft and Google all provide detailed reports about their
environmental efforts. They have significant resources to analyse their
operations in detail, then make the changes that will have a long term impact.
Adopting the [GRI Standards](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards) for
reporting is an accepted and well understood mechanism.

For companies with tighter budgetary constraints, the actions of smaller
organisations who nonetheless still have a large impact can be insightful. [A
recent example of this is the Wikimedia
Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2019/09/19/how-the-wikimedia-foundation-is-making-efforts-to-go-green/),
who have introduced policies such as sourcing renewable energy for their server
footprint, selecting offices close to public transport, embracing remote working
and encouraging video conferencing in place of in-person visits. [Activist
corporate purchasing
policies](https://www.cio.com/article/3434058/corporate-purchasing-an-unexpected-way-to-fight-climate-change.html) can
make a big difference.

The incentive is there for companies to start right now. Sustainability is a
marketable differentiator. Governments are slow to act but when they do, [change
will be expensive for those who are forced into
action](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuel-divestment) rather
than taking the initiative to act first. Companies are often seen as the problem
but actually they can be the catalyst for the solution.
