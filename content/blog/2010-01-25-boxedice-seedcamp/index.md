_Originally [published on the Server Density
blog](https://blog.serverdensity.com/boxed-ices-application-to-mini-seedcamp-london-2009/)._

Every year [Seedcamp](http://www.seedcamp.com/) runs an event for 20 companies
selected from applications and interviews of hundreds to participate in a week
of mentoring followed by an investment pitch, and subsequent seed investment in
~5 companies. However, they also run a series of smaller 1 day events around
Europe called Mini Seedcamp. These involve a number of talks, mentoring sessions
and may also lead to an investment or invitation to attend the full week later
in the year.

Boxed Ice was one of the [winners of Seedcamp Week
2009](http://blog.boxedice.com/2009/09/26/seedcamp-2009-winner/) but we also
attended the [Mini Seedcamp London on 20th April
2009](http://www.seedcamp.com/pages/mini_seedcamps09#London).

Both Seedcamp events require an application and since the [first Mini Seedcamp
event (Zagreb)](http://seedcamp.com/pages/zagreb10) application deadline is
coming up soon (27th Jan), I thought it would be interesting to post the Boxed
Ice application from last year.

## Things that have changed

A lot of things have changed since the application was written. These include:

- Originally it was just myself officially involved. The company had not been
  incorporated at the time and [Server
  Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), our server monitoring service, was
  only in early testing as a concept to see if it was of interest to anyone.
  But the important thing was the product was available and working. Boxed Ice
  Ltd was formed on 6th April a few weeks before the actual event, although
  after the application, and we now have several staff.
- We now have our [server monitoring iPhone
  application](https://www.serverdensity.com/iphone/) released, with the very
  popular push notification alerts.
- We didn’t ever release a self-hosted version of Server Density, and have no
  plans to do so.

## Boxed Ice Seedcamp Application

These are the original questions and answers with no alterations. The questions
may be different this year.

### Education and work history (briefly!)

I am currently in my second year of a law degree at University of Birmingham,
due to graduate in 2010. I work part time as Senior Technical Strategist at
London based internet company, [eConversions](http://www.econversions.co.uk/),
where I advise management on technical issues. eConversions employs 25 people in
search marketing and web publishing.

Last year we generated over £100 million in sales revenue for our clients,
launched [vouchercodes.co.uk](https://www.vouchercodes.co.uk/) which now has
millions of visitors per month and sold social business
directory [welovelocal.com](http://www.welovelocal.com/) to GCap Media, the UK’s
largest commercial radio group. I was lead developer on the welovelocal.com
project and responsible for the technical handover to GCap.

Prior to that, I ran my own software development company which I started whilst
at 6th form college in 2005. The company, [Olate](http://www.olate.co.uk/),
employed 3 staff who worked on our 2 commercial PHP software packages before
being acquired at the end of 2007, partly by eConversions.

### Tell us about your completed projects

- [cardsmart.co.uk](http://www.cardsmart.co.uk/) – With eConversions
  overseeing the core development of the site, I was responsible for
  implementing the key functionality before handing over day-to-day
  development to one of our partners.
- [welovelocal.com](http://www.welovelocal.com/) – As lead developer, I was
  responsible for the development of the site including working with large
  amounts of geo and business data to build a successful social business
  reviews site. This included setting up the server infrastructure and
  managing the technical handover when the site was acquired by GCap Media.
- [olate.co.uk](http://www.olate.co.uk/) – The original website, olate.com,
  was started in 2003 as a project to learn PHP by writing my own and
  collecting other author’s web development tutorials in a central location. I
  developed an open source project (a download manager) then moved onto the
  first paid product, an ecommerce system that allowed other developers to
  sell and license their software.

### Give us an impressive fact about yourself

During my first year of 6th form in 2004, I was asked to write a book by the
then relatively new publishing company, Packt Publishing. The book, titled
Invision Power Board 2: A User Guide, was published in 2005. It can
be [purchased on
Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Invision-Power-Board-User-Guide/dp/1904811388/).

### What are you creating?

We have developed a server monitoring application (written in PHP) that uses an
agent (written in Python) installed on the remote server to report statistics
such as load average and memory usage. This is then graphed and displayed
through a web interface with the ability to configure e-mail or phone SMS
alerts. Server administrators can therefore be notified when critical events
occur and plan future capacity by comparing historical trends. The product is
either hosted by us or can be installed on the customer’s own server. With the
latter option, SMS alerts are still sent through our servers.

### What gives you an unfair advantage and how will you sustain it?

Current server monitoring products have poorly designed interfaces, are complex
to set up, do not allow easy phone (SMS) alerts and tend to be very expensive
“enterprise solutions”. Our product is tackling all those areas to try and do
the basics right to create a product that does the one job extremely well. Just
because a system administrator works on a command line all day does not mean
they do not want a well thought out interface and easy configuration of their
monitoring tools.

Equally, just because you are monitoring the status of a server does not mean
that you have many £1000s / $1000s to spend on “enterprise solutions”. We
believe a good product can be created that does the required job, follows good
usability guidelines and is reasonably priced.

### How will you make money?

The product will be licensed in the same manner as [Fog Creek’s
FogBugz](http://www.fogbugz.com/) product

- Hosted by us for a monthly fee based on the number of servers being
  monitored; or
- Hosted on your own server with a license fee based on the number of servers
  being monitored with ongoing (annual) support/update contract In addition,
  customers will need to purchase SMS credits to be able to send SMS alerts to
  phones either from the hosted version or the installed version. Whilst the
  profit margin on these would be negligible, bulk purchases would add up.

### Why is this team the right one for this company?

I believe I have a great deal of relevant experience both running my own
software company and working within a larger organisation. This allows me to see
things from several perspectives to effectively combine my business experiences
with development skills.

### If you are incorporated (as a company): who owns what, and what is the detailed funding history? If you are not yet incorporated: who will own what percentage of the company?

The company is not yet incorporated. Forming a company immediately just results
in more costs, particularly if you have little or no revenue and still have to
pay monthly overheads such as payment processing. We are currently in private
beta testing and once that is completed and the product is ready to launch, that
will be the right time to progress through the incorporation processes.

I will own 100% of the company.

### We are really impressed by teams that get stuff done. Please provide a URL (with login details if necessary) to a prototype of your product, or failing that to a video of a prototype of your product

[http://www.serverdensity.com](https://www.serverdensity.com/) includes
screenshots and a 2 min video demo.

### To date, what specific progress have you made in building your product/company (e.g. development milestones, feature additions, customer sign-ups, etc.)?

The product beta was finished on 9 Mar and is now in invite-only beta testing
at [www.serverdensity.com](https://www.serverdensity.com/). We have a small
number of beta testers and just (18 Mar) conducted our first phone “beta
feedback interview” with a user. Several more are scheduled for the coming week.
Development started at the beginning of Feb 09.

### What is the single largest competitive threat to your business that you can identify today?

[Big Brother](http://www.bb4.org/) and [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) are the
classic, open source server monitoring systems. Commercial providers such
as [uptimesoftware.com](http://www.uptimesoftware.com/) and [nimsoft.com](http://www.nimsoft.com/)also
offer “enterprise” monitoring products. Hyperic
([www.hyperic.com](http://www.hyperic.com/)) could be considered the biggest
competitor because they are starting to adopt more “web 2.0” style marketing
projects such as [cloudstatus.com](http://www.cloudstatus.com/). Our product is
much more lightweight when compared to these. Simplicity is important, which
seems to have been forgotten with the current options on the market. We believe
the necessary functionality can be implemented to do the required job without
generating a bloated product.

### Planning for the worst is a key to great success. Think hard: what might go wrong? How can you minimize those risks?

The most likely point of failure will be lack of revenue to allow breakeven.
This is particularly the case if there are overheads such as monthly server
costs or payment processing minimum fees. To avoid that, I have only spent a
very minimum amount in order to develop and then test the product with beta
testers before pushing ahead with incorporation and attempting to charge for
use.

### What do you hope to get out of the Seedcamp experience?

My primary goal is to use it to raise awareness of the product by meeting people
in the same industry, who are the main target audience for the product. Any
discussion and/or offers for funding will be secondary.

### Who are your main current or potential competitors as well as identified potential new entrants?

See my answer to “What is the single largest competitive threat to your business
that you can identify today?”

### Does any founder have a conflicting future commitment? If so, what? Are any of you involved in other projects?

Being in the 2nd year of my Law degree in the UK, I plan to complete the final
year in September 2009 – June 2010. However, I believe this will have no affect
on my ability to work on the company. I ran my software development company –
Olate – for 3 years, 2 of which whilst in full time 6th form college. I have
also been able to develop the product so far whilst at university full time.
That said, there is an option to take a year out or leave the course completely
if that becomes necessary. University is great but if it is a choice between
that and running a successful company, I will choose the latter.

### Does any actual or potential legal restriction or limitation apply to any team member which we should know about (e.g., non-disclosure, non-compete)?

No

### Apart from open source software, was any of your code written by anyone not on the team?

No

### Let us say you have 15 seconds to pitch your business. Can you describe your business?

Easy server monitoring of your server’s health. Server Density tells you when
things are going wrong.
