Deciding what to build and when is the most difficult task for any
product/engineering team. There are always multiple competing interests that
appear at different times, pulling you in every direction.

Without an understanding of how to prioritise, you can easily switch contexts
too often, damaging productivity and making everything feel manic.

Despite this, it is it possible to define some prioritisation rules. These are
mine:

1. **Critical problems waking up your team**  
   Your team are the first of two crucial stakeholders. It sounds obvious, but
   without team members you can't deliver your service! Stress and fatigue
   caused by outages have a knock-on effect on your customers because product
   quality suffers. Engineers must be on call for their own code and systems,
   but if there are too many out of hours incidents and the trend is not
   towards a reduction in volume, they will eventually leave. Being woken up
   (or interrupted out of hours) has a huge impact on quality of life which has
   to be addressed quickly.
2. **Critical problems breaking service for your customers**  
   Customers are the second of the two crucial stakeholders that determine
   prioritisation. Your business only survives because customers generate
   revenue but without your team, you cannot service your customers. As such,
   customers come second. But any critical issue that is breaking a core
   service for your customers must be solved quickly. This can range from a
   complete outage to a major bug that is preventing functionality from
   working. These types of issues should be parachuted into the current
   development cycle and fixed first. It's much easier to keep existing
   customers happier than to sign up new ones.
3. **Bugs and improvements requested by or affecting existing customers**  
   Linked to #2, keeping existing customers happy is the best way to build a
   sustainable business. This is especially the case with SaaS, where accounts
   often grow and revenue can be increased without anywhere near the cost of
   acquiring a new customer. Existing customers also know what they want to see
   in the product because they're actually using it. You don't necessarily have
   to agree with them and it may not be appropriate to build everything every
   customer asks for, but bugs and smaller improvements help to improve
   retention. [SaaS revenue

4. **Innovation**  
   Since it has never been easier to start a business, differentiation is
   crucial to standing out amongst the inevitable competition. Products have to
   continually evolve because what is differentiating today is just a standard
   feature tomorrow. This means having a unique perspective of the market and
   what customers want from it. Building solutions to interesting problems
   helps attract the best team. It makes customers want to stay with you
   because they see the product evolve. And it makes you stand out from
   competitors. You can't stay ahead just by copying.
5. **What lost deals or prospects are asking for**  
   Having a unique position in the market isn't sufficient if you don't offer
   the key features everyone is asking for. Understanding why customers are not
   buying and/or what they are asking your sales team for will give you a good
   insight into what you should be building. Sometimes you can commit to
   delivering requests as part of a deal (or with a chargeable services element
   on top). I'd also argue there's a place for a whole product team dedicated
   just to building requests that come out of the sales and marketing discovery
   process.
6. **What your competitors are doing**  
   This is often linked to #5 if competitors are defining the market. You need
   to ensure you cover at least the core functionality for buyers who have a
   simple checklist, but then this is where #4 comes in to make your offering
   stand out. However, it is the lowest priority to simply copy what
   competitors are doing because by definition doing so will mean you're always
   behind.

Whether you agree with the ordering above or not, the important thing is to have
a set of rules which can be applied to inbound requests.

You're going to get input from your team, customers, investors, board members,
friends, competitors and more. [Technical debt, refactoring and

also have to be considered (maybe it comes under #1 in extreme circumstances,
but it can probably be considered as part of a project that fits into one of the
normal priorities).

Things will also change over time.

Only one thing can be top. Unless there is a single, ordered list of numbered
priorities, nothing is the priority.
