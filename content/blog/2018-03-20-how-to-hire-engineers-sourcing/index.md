How to find and hire good engineers seems to be a common problem amongst
startups of all sizes. Whether you’re looking for your first non-founder hire,
an executive level CTO or are building out a large team, sourcing and hiring
engineers is difficult.

In this post I’ll start at the beginning with how to go about sourcing
candidates – getting applications into the top of the funnel in the first place.
A followup post will go into how to run the actual hiring process itself.

## Groundwork – what is it like to work here?

Your first task is to put in place the foundations needed to get people to
apply. You don’t *need* to do any (or all) of these things but they are worth
the one-time investment which will pay off with a larger candidate pool in the
future.

The key question you have to answer is: why would I want to work for you?

You need to provide evidence to help potential applications answer this question
and then the followup: why would I want to work for you instead of Company X.

You essentially need to show off!

So how do you do that? This can be through your website and/or the job ad
itself, but you should be thinking about the following:

- Where will the candidate be working if they are successful? If this is an
  office-based job then explaining the details about the office environment
  with photos and videos will help them picture where they will be. This
  should include basic information like the office address, nearest public
  transport, facilities such as showers, bike storage, desk layout and places
  to go to eat/drink in the area. Do you have a philosophy behind your office
  choice e.g. open plan offices to help people communicate, or quiet areas for
  engineers to get into the zone.
- How will they work? What tools and processes do you have in place? How does
  the engineering process work and what technologies are being used? If the
  team is remote, how do things actually work – chat, video calls, regular
  meetups, etc? These are all good topics for blog posts as well.
- What are your company policies? Publish your handbook if you can but if not,
  highlight key policies like holiday, sickness, maternity/paternity leave,
  complaints procedure, code of conduct, pay and performance reviews and how
  the policies might be adjusted in response to feedback.
- What are the company benefits? [This is an important part of the overall
  compensation
  package](https://davidmytton.blog/innovation-in-incentives-how-should-startups-structure-salaries-bonuses-commission-stock-options/) but
  you may offer certain things to everyone e.g. insurance, car, mobile phone,
  equipment, travel allowance, conference allowance, profit sharing, share
  options, etc.

A good way to find out what to include is to ask your current team and/or think
about what questions you had when you joined your first company.

Most businesses are quite bad at showing off their policies, even when they are
positive and a great selling point. You can stand out by being transparent and
having the candidate already partially sold on working for you before they even
speak to you.

This is a good opportunity to [consider whether your policies are appropriate
for different types of
people](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/HOWTO_recruit_and_retain_women_in_tech_workplaces).
Fresh graduates renting with friends have very different requirements from an
industry veteran living with a family.

Showing you have thought about key things like a code of conduct and
maternity/paternity leave also has an important effect on encouraging more
diverse applications. With the diversity challenges in the IT industry, it is
beneficial to show candidates that you have thought about this in depth and
already applied policies within the company. Having to adopt policies
dynamically if problems arise is not a good way to build a trusting, friendly
work environment.

## The job ad

The ad itself is probably the first time a potential candidate has encountered
your organisation, so it has to sell both the job itself and the company. Many
of the things above can be included in the ad so it works as a standalone
article e.g. if it is read on a job board outside your own website, or sent via
email.

Things you might want to consider including in the ad:

- A detailed list of the tasks and responsibilities that are part of the role.
  This should answer the question “what will I be doing?”.
- Who they will be working with and for, and what the day to day might look
  like. Knowing which team or group you’re going into allows you to understand
  the context of the role in the wider organisation, and perhaps even look up
  some of the people who are already working there. Understanding who your
  manager is going to be also gives you a view on the company hierarchy and
  seniority of the role. Reporting to a project manager is quite different
  from reporting to the CEO, for example.
- Describe the selection process so the applicant knows what is going to
  happen and when. If you can give timelines then that is particularly helpful
  (and unusual). The experience of most people of applying to jobs is like a
  black hole – they never hear back and even when they do, it’s on what seems
  like an arbitrary timeline. There is basically no reason to keep candidates
  on hold and you should aim to progress people within days or a week. As the
  process gets to the end it may lengthen because it can be easier
  logistically to combine interview days, for example, but the early stages of
  an application process should be very efficient. Consider how you would want
  to know the current status of the process if you were the applicant. Make
  the whole process exceptional and the candidate will think of your
  positively in the long run even if they’re not hired. You may want to work
  with them in the future, or they may buy your product.
- Avoid listing detailed requirements and long lists of “must have”
  attributes. I prefer to have more applications that I filter rather than
  have potentially good people self-filter because they don’t happen to hit
  one thing in your list. [This is a particular problem with trying to improve
  your application
  diversity](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).
- I also like to leave off any degree requirements. Many of my best engineers
  have had no formal qualifications and are were self taught. Of course, this
  may vary depending on the types of problems you’re trying to solve – deep
  technical requirements or specialist topics may require certain
  qualifications. There is also a certain advantage to having gone through the
  experience of university (regardless of the subject), but it does select out
  many excellent engineers. Again, I prefer to filter on other criteria
  yourself e.g. their experience.
- Where possible use real numbers to show off about the interesting things
  your company is doing. This can include customers (numbers & names), money
  raised, revenue and the scale of the technical challenges (e.g. requests per
  second or dataset sizes). Some of these are vanity metrics but they help to
  add to the context. Engineers like to know they’re working on meaningful
  projects.

## Where to source candidates

Unless you have a big reputation, you’re unlikely to get many direct
applications with the ad solely on your own website. Even the biggest companies
use various methods to bring candidates in. There isn’t just a single location
that will work so you need to put time and effort into all of these.

### Job boards

Job boards are a relatively quick and passive place to get your job ad out.
They’re about volume so aren’t necessarily going to get you targeted candidates,
but will help to increase the reach of your ad.

There are specialist job boards for different types of roles and people. For
example, [PowerToFly](https://powertofly.com/) is a recruitment platform for
women whereas [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.io/) is specifically for remote jobs.
I recommend building a list of the main job boards relevant to your role and
then posting on all of them.

Other ones to check
are [AngelList](https://angel.co/), [weworkremotely.com](https://weworkremotely.com/), [jobspresso.co](https://jobspresso.co/), [workingnomads.co](https://www.workingnomads.co/jobs) and [WorkInStartups](https://workinstartups.com/).

### Candidate search platforms

Direct candidate search is time consuming but is a good way for you to filter
through profiles on specific search terms and then directly get in touch with
people who fit the criteria.

LinkedIn and [StackOverflow
Careers](https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/uk/talent) are two popular
examples, with StackOverflow being very specifically for engineering roles.

LinkedIn also has a job board product which is worth using because the ads show
on your business profile and it has a huge audience, but you will be able to be
more targeted if you spend the time to search profiles. The problem with
LinkedIn is it is very general and I’ve found engineers are less likely to
maintain active accounts and/or pay attention to messages which are often spam.

Other sites to consider using
include [Snap.hr](https://snap.hr/), [Hired](https://hired.co.uk/) and [AmazingHiring](https://amazinghiring.com/).

### Community involvement

Much more long term but often with good quality results, getting involved with
the relevant engineering community groups will help you build a profile and meet
people with similar interests. This can be specific technology meetups
e.g. [London Python](https://www.meetup.com/LondonPython/) or focused on
techie-types in a certain geographic area e.g. [Oxford
Geeks](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-Geeks/).

Speaking at meetups and conferences is a good way to build your reputation. Aim
to educate and/or tell an interesting story rather than going with the goal of
selling/hiring, but remembering to mention what it is you’re looking for at the
end of your talk! It is usually easier to get a speaker slot at a meetup because
the organisers are usually looking for people to give talks. These can then lead
into conference slots in the future.

In London,
the [SiliconMilkRoundabout](https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com/) event which
is a larger scale jobs fair. They have minimum requirements for applicants so
there is a quality bar to the people you meet as a company.

### Education links

Although limited to graduates or academics, building links with universities and
other educational establishments can help you with a regular pipeline of
(inexperienced) talent. This is essential for building a company in the long
term but does have training overheads because they are all going to be
relatively inexperienced. Timings are also linked to academic terms so this
isn’t as useful for immediate hiring needs.

Building an internship and educational recruitment program is quite involved but
there is a good book on this topic: [Recruit or
Die](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Recruit-Die-Business-Beat-YoungTalent-ebook/dp/B000UCUX4G/).

### Recruiters

I have left recruiters to last because I think they’re the least effective
method of finding people.

[I have written about this in more detail
elsewhere](https://davidmytton.blog/when-does-it-make-sense-to-use-a-recruiter-for-hiring-engineers/) but
the problem is that in all cases, the incentives are misaligned. You need a
recruiter who 1) is looking for good candidates that fit your criteria; 2) who
will find you someone who is good to work with; and 3) someone who will will
stay with you for a long time

The only way to find a recruiter who can hit all three of these is by hiring
someone full time in-house. Using a success fee or retainer through a
recruitment agency means the financial incentives simply don’t match. Either the
incentive optimises for finding someone quickly or to create a long process
which maximises the retainer income.

Hiring a full-time recruiter who you know gets your company values and will
actually work in the same office and probably sit next to the person they hire
is the best way to align incentives..

However, in-house recruiters have all the overhead as a full time employee so
aren’t necessarily appropriate for small numbers of hires. They only really make
sense for growing big teams.

A possible compromise is an exclusive, contract recruiter who is working for you
for a defined length of time e.g. 6-9 months. That person can get into the
company culture and take the time to find the right candidates, but then leave
once they have built the team.

The advantage of using recruiters is they supposedly have good networks of
people, although that is really only true for the top end executive search
firms, if you’re looking for contract roles or for less skilled general
administrative positions (not engineering).

The best engineers can pick and choose a small number of places they want to
work at, so they don’t use recruiters. This means for hiring engineers, it’s
really tricky to find a recruiter that will actually deliver.

The best way forward is either having someone full time on your team to focus on
this and/or focusing on the other sourcing options above to seek out the
candidates yourself. Indeed, building your early team is probably the most
important thing you can be working on. Without a good team, you can’t build and
deliver a quality product to your customers.
