I just finished reading [The Fate of Rome by Kyle
Harper](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691166834/the-fate-of-rome).
The core thesis is that the Roman Empire suffered from the combined effects of
volcanic eruptions, climate instability, and pandemic, which contributed to its
collapse at the hands of revolution, invasion and institutional decay.

My takeaway is that no one thing “caused” the fall of the Roman Empire, but the
internal, human-caused stresses like political infighting created
vulnerabilities which were exacerbated by environmental factors.

Early on, the Romans were able to benefit from the [Roman Climate
Optimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period), which was an
unusually stable period of warm weather in Europe between 250 BC and 400 AD. The
book goes into detail describing how it’s no coincidence that the Empire
flourished during this period. Indeed, political problems, war, and revolution
were regular features of Roman society, yet it was thriving.

As this period of calm came to an end, the resiliency of the system was hit by
more extreme conditions, and pandemic in particular, which reduced the
resiliency of the Empire.

If you were sitting in Rome in AD 150, you would be looking back on several
centuries of amazing progress. Maybe not a peaceful period, but certainly
improvements in daily life, many technological innovations, and a growing
empire. Yet the future wasn’t going to turn out so well.

The same could be said of someone sitting in London in 1910. The end of the
Napoleonic Wars in 1815 brought a period of relative peace and massive
technological development, but things also weren’t going to continue that way.

It’s quite easy to argue that modern civilization is much more robust and
resilient than any ancient society. The likes of Steven Pinker have done a good
job at documenting the vast improvements experienced over the last few
centuries, and we have just demonstrated how technology can beat a novel
pandemic (despite many failures and without a full accounting of the various
social and economic costs). But what are the weaknesses few are paying attention
to today?

![Timeline of Rome](roman-timeline.png "Timeline of the Roman Empire, from [The

As it’s such a central part of my life, our computing infrastructure stands out
to me as an area of concern. I’m not so worried about the foundations – the
underlying protocols are well designed and pretty robust – but knowing how most
software is written doesn’t inspire confidence! This is particularly true when
it comes to cybersecurity, an area where I don’t think we’ve seen a real
catastrophe…yet. I particularly enjoyed [my discussion with Thomas Ptacek on
this topic last
year](https://console.dev/podcast/s02e02-security-thomas-ptacek-fly.io/). The
growing popularity of strictly-typed memory safe programming languages is
reassuring, at least until you consider how much software is written in unsafe
languages like C!

Are we in our own “Roman Climate Optimum”? Has the time since 1945 been a period
of relative peace with limited environmental catastrophe? The sun [has been
stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event). We’ve had no major
volcanic eruptions
([Eyjafjallajökull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel_disruption_after_the_2010_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull_eruption) not
withstanding). COVID has been called a “starter pandemic” because of how much
worse it could’ve been – we were surprisingly successful with the vaccine,
but [that was more luck than good
planning](https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-to-Prevent-the-Next-Pandemic). Are the
systems of society sufficiently resilient to allow us to effectively deal with
the next crisis, [whatever it might
be](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-09/niall-ferguson-the-next-global-disaster-is-already-on-its-way)?
Will we be able to [adapt sufficiently to climate
change](https://davidmytton.blog/investing-in-environmental-adaptation-vs-solutions-to-climate-change/)?

How much we rely on electricity, and [how precisely that system must be
controlled](https://www.drax.com/power-generation/great-balancing-act-takes-keep-power-grid-stable/),
is another area where my interests overlap. Cybersecurity is particularly
important for critical energy infrastructure. Electrification is a good step,
but we’re stacking complex dependencies upon complex dependencies, and that
doesn’t bode well for full system resiliency.

[Back in 2019 I wrote about the risks from electricity system
failure](https://davidmytton.blog/how-do-you-access-knowledge-without-electricity/) as
one of the “medium likelihood / high impact” risks on the UK Government Risk
Register. Of course, just a few months later we had a pandemic, which was also
considered “medium “medium likelihood / high impact”. [The average lifespan of a
civilization is 336
years](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190218-the-lifespans-of-ancient-civilisations-compared),
so I find it interesting to consider what lessons we can learn about our own
situation today.
