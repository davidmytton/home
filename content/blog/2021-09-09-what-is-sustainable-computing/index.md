I’ve started maintaining a website page of [interesting and useful resources
related to sustainable
computing](https://davidmytton.blog/sustainable-computing/). The first part of
that involves defining what sustainable computing is.

My definition is below.

## What is sustainable computing?

Sustainable computing concerns the consumption of computing resources in a way
that means such usage has a net zero impact on the environment, a broad concept
that includes energy, ecosystems, pollution and natural resources.

I consider that individual impact on the environment rounds to zero because
although some people will change their behaviour, most won’t. This means that
systems need to change. Energy production, transportation, manufacturing,
agriculture. The transition to sustainability needs to be done on behalf of the
individual by the system and at a large scale, so individuals can benefit from
that change by default.

In computing, this means the organisations responsible for manufacturing
components, building equipment, writing software, operating data centres, and
running networks have responsibility for achieving sustainability.

Sustainability strategies in computing tend to focus on energy and the
transition to renewables – the use stage. This is important, but not the only
factor.

Sustainable computing therefore involves not just renewable energy, but also
minimising water stress, developing policies around the right to repair and
recycling of materials through a circular economy, energy efficiency of hardware
and software, promoting good governance of resources, transparency, and
consistent reporting.

communities, data, papers, reports, and tools, and some brief comments on each.
