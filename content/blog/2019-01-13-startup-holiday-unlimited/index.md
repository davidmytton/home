As an early startup founder, you have unlimited flexibility to work when and
where you want, and for as long as you want. It only makes sense to extend that
flexibility to the whole team, right? Indeed, that’s where the idea of
“unlimited” holiday came about. I adopted this as our holiday policy when Server
Density was founded in 2009.

However, it didn’t really work out as intended. The problem is that there is
always something else you *should* be doing. It’s never a good time to go away
and you certainly can’t disconnect completely. I travelled quite extensively in
2010 both to the US for the company and my first ever trip to Japan on holiday.
But I didn’t ever have a true “holiday” in that I could completely disconnect
from work.

If the founder and CEO can’t take real time off, how do you expect the rest of
the team to be able to interpret the “unlimited holiday policy”?

Over 9 years at Server Density, we tried several different approaches to holiday
policy. [I’ve previously written about startup financial
incentives](https://davidmytton.blog/innovation-in-incentives-how-should-startups-structure-salaries-bonuses-commission-stock-options/) so
this post is about the different holiday policies we tried:

## Unlimited holiday policy

With this policy, there is no quota and anyone can take as much time off as they
like, subject to manager approval. The company does not count the days off each
person takes, although it is of course still recorded so everyone knows if
someone is off.

### Pros

- It sounds good, especially to those new to startups. Everyone likes the idea
  of “unlimited” because it means they don’t need to worry about whether
  taking a day from their allowance is a good use of time, and won’t miss out
  on events because they’ve used all their allowance.
- You can use it to make the most of travel opportunities. The further away
  you go from home, the longer it takes to get into the timezone and so the
  more time you want to spend in a destination. I know 2 weeks is the minimum
  amount of time I would want to take for a trip to Japan.

### Cons

- There is no guidance about how much is “reasonable”. You will probably not
  hire someone who will take advantage and disappear for 3 months, but what is
  the right amount? Expectations are ambiguous and if the founders/senior team
  are not taking much time off, the rest of the company may feel pressure to
  avoid holiday.
- Without guidance, some people will take off more time than others. Perhaps
  those will fewer deadlines or less pressure will find it easier to take
  holidays. Managers will be reluctant to approve holiday, especially longer
  trips. And when holiday is taken there will be an unspoken pressure to
  “check in”, with email or Slack.
- If you don’t actually track time off, you can’t tell if someone is abusing
  the system or let other people know people are off. So you do have to track
  it, which means it is not “unlimited holiday” but “no measured allowances”.
- The startup marketing doesn’t match the reality, which hurts your long term
  reputation. If a new candidate asks your team (or reads a Glassdoor review),
  will they be enthusiastic about the reality of working there?

## Bonuses to encourage people to take time off

With the realisation that the pure “unlimited holiday” policy wasn’t necessarily
working out for everyone, we decided to introduce an incentive to take time off.
This amounted to a £1000 cash bonus at the end of the year if you took at least
25 days in the calendar year. This was originally a 50% salary bonus in the
final month of the year but we adjusted that to a fixed amount because it became
expensive.

### Pros

- Using a financial incentive to encourage behaviour is a well understood
  approach. It is used in all sorts of areas of life, from sales commissions
  through to encouraging people to give up smoking.
- It makes it clear what the holiday policy expectations are. The actual
  number of 25 days could be changed but it sets a clear guideline for how
  many days you are encouraged to take.

### Cons

- It assumes everyone is incentivised by money.
- How do you set the amount? £1000 means different things to different people
  but a percentage of salary is also somewhat arbitrary and can prove
  expensive.
- How do you deal with edge cases e.g. someone who takes 24 days? Is it fair
  that someone who takes 25 days gets the bonus whereas the person who just
  misses it does not?
- If someone suddenly realises towards the end of the year that they need to
  take time off, what happens if it is not a good time or lots of people are
  in a similar position? You could see lots of holiday requests right at the
  end of the year.
- How do you deal with people who join the company part of the way through the
  year? Pro-rate the 25 days? Pro-rate the bonus?
- It introduces a large cash outflow in the final month of the year. As your
  team grows, this could become a problem for cashflow.

## Setting an expected minimum with active encouragement

After trying the above, this is the approach we were using before Server Density
was acquired. We had an unlimited holiday policy, tracked all time off but set
an expectation that everyone would take [at least the UK statutory
minimum](https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights) – 28 days. Anything over
that was generally allowed, subject to sufficient notice, availability of any
cover and in consideration of occasional deadlines. In practice, we rarely
denied requests for time off and most people were in the 30-35-days range each
year. We also removed the bonus.

### Pros

- The expectation is clear and it [follows the legal
  requirements](https://blogs.orrick.com/employment/2014/10/29/holidays-unlimited/).
  The UK fits nicely in-between the crazily low allowances of the US and the
  quite-high expectations common in Europe, so it feels like a reasonable
  middle-ground.
- It is a good benefit to talk about when recruiting because it’s still
  unusual to have “unlimited” holiday in the UK, outside of tech startups.
- It is down to managers to ensure their team take the minimum time off,
  spread throughout the year. This removes some of the responsibility from the
  team member and makes the manager think about any pressure they might be
  applying to work under unreasonable pressure.

### Cons

- It is still “unlimited” and so the value of having a day off is less than if
  each person had an annual allowance. To me, this means taking paid holiday
  doesn’t have the same feeling of value. If you can have as many days off as
  you like, you value them less. Using something like [time off in
  lieu](https://www.gov.uk/overtime-your-rights/time-off-and-paid-leave) therefore
  has no effect and individuals may appreciate the holiday time less.
- There is an upper limit. As a founder, you have to set the example and what
  if you want to go on a 3 week holiday? That’s almost all your allowance
  gone.

## Conclusion – how would I do it today?

Unlimited holiday by itself simply doesn’t work. [Many
others](https://blog.charliehr.com/how-we-fixed-unlimited-holiday/) [have
found](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-travis-ci-went-from-open-minimum-vacation-policy-mathias-meyer/) [this](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/25/richard-branson-unlimited-holiday-job-insecurity),
too.

Introducing financial incentives also doesn’t work. The differences are marginal
and it can end up being expensive for the company.

However, the motivations for exploring these kinds of policies are still
essentially valid. You want employees to feel trusted to balance the needs of
the business and their desire for time off, give them the flexibility to enjoy
life and make expectations clear so that nobody feels unnecessary pressure to
work so much they burn out.

If I was creating a new company holiday policy today, I would go with fixed
allowances. This would probably start at the UK statutory minimum during the
employee’s first year and then gradually increase the longer they have been with
the business. [This is similar to how Basecamp run
things](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/benefits-and-perks.md#paid-time-off) –
3 weeks plus a few extra days here and there if needed.

I would also be flexible e.g. if someone had used all their days off but wanted
a day or two more for an important event, it seems unnecessarily mean to deny
the request. I would also consider allowing some unused time off to be rolled
over into the next year. This would encourage employees to think about time off
as something of value, but also that the company encouraged people to use it.

Ultimately this is about balancing the requirements of the business and the
needs of the team, which should align almost exactly most of the time. If
employees feel rested and relaxed, and feel like they don’t need to strictly
count time off, the business benefits as well as the employee. The advantage of
early-stage startups is that you can experiment with these things.
