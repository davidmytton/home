For the last few months [since the StackPath
acquisition](https://blog.stackpath.com/server-density-joins-stackpath), I have
been shedding all the administrative tasks of a CEO of a small startup and
focusing more and more of my time on product.

This has been initially scoped to integrating [Server Density
monitoring](https://www.serverdensity.com/) into [the StackPath
platform](https://www.stackpath.com/services/monitoring/) but has been
broadening to multiple products across the platform.

I am used to shifting between many different tasks and responsibilities so
focusing entirely on product has been a new experience for me. As a result, I
have been spending as much time as possible learning about what it means to do
product management.

Learning something new is a great time to write about the experience. There are
valuable insights that can be shared from a beginner mindset. Once you “know”
something, you think about problems in a different way.

So this post is a collection of the resources I’ve found useful in learning
about running product engineering ~6 months into the role.

## Books for product managers

- [Death by
  Meeting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49040.Death_by_Meeting) – the
  book that has had the most impact on me about how to run teams.
- [High Growth
  Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40536148-high-growth-handbook) –
  the chapter on building both executive teams and a product management
  organisation have been most relevant. [Read my
  review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2470889050).
- [Principles: Life and
  Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles) – lacking
  some practical advice for actual implementation, this is an interesting look
  at how to productise your own principles into an operating system for your
  own life, and work. [Read my
  review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2243837150).
- [The Lean Product Playbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25374501) –
  a great framework to really get into building a product that addresses
  customer needs, and ultimately achieves product/market fit. [Read my
  review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2507862904).
- [Product Leadership: How Top Product Managers Launch Awesome Products and
  Build Successful
  Teams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148326-product-leadership) – I
  found this book to be quite good at understanding ideal team structures and
  management approaches, but less helpful on the actual day to day of how a
  product manager should approach their role. It’s worth a read for someone
  getting into product management for the first time, or someone who is in the
  process of building a product management team structure. [Read my
  review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2494133542).

## Product management podcasts

I have yet to find a good podcast that is just about product management, so here
are some specific episodes from more general podcasts that I’d recommend
listening to.

- [Masters of Scale: Marissa Mayer](https://overcast.fm/+I6DCjRxA0) – I find
  this podcast series very difficult to listen to because it is incredibly
  over-produced, but this one made me do further research into how Google runs
  product management and so was valuable in that sense!
- [The A16Z podcast](https://a16z.com/podcasts/) as a whole is worth listening
  to, but specifically related to product I would suggest [High Growth in
  Product (and tech)](https://overcast.fm/+BlzG1SMvQ) which is a podcast
  interview with Elad Gil of the High Growth Handbook mentioned above. Also
  listen to The Basics of Growth [Part
  1](https://overcast.fm/+BlzEI0vMM) and [Part
  2](https://overcast.fm/+BlzEUClNM).

## Events for product managers

Generally I don’t find attending conferences to be a good use of time. The
travel, disruption to routine and low signal to noise ratio of talks means I’d
usually much rather watch the videos after. However, I have found these to be
worth the time:

- [Mind the Product Conference](http://mtpcon.com/) is the main conference but
  I attended only the [Leadership
  Forum](http://mtpcon.com/london/leadership-forum/), which was worth it
  because of the small number of attendees.
- Every industry has their own niche conference which is worth attending just
  to understand the overall landscape. For monitoring,
  it’s [Monitorama](https://monitorama.com/). And for SaaS in general,
  it’s [SaaStr](https://www.saastr.com/events/). Be very picky and very
  specific.

## Product management blogs

Where specific articles but not the whole blog is useful, they’re listed in the
next section. These blogs are worth subscribing to in their entirety.

- [25iq](https://25iq.com/) – not a product specific blog but it covers
  product, startups, pricing, unit cost models and finance which are all very
  useful in a startup environment.
- [Andrew Chen](https://andrewchen.co/)
- [Steven Sinofsky](https://medium.com/@stevesi)
- [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://svpg.com/articles/) and in
  particular, [Product vs IT
  Mindset](https://svpg.com/product-vs-it-mindset/), [Moving from an IT to a
  Product
  Organisation](https://svpg.com/moving-from-an-it-to-a-product-organization/), [The
  VP Product Role](https://svpg.com/the-vp-product-role/).
- [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/) – one of the small number of
  publications I pay for. Not product specific but focused on business
  strategy of the tech industry.

## Articles for product managers

- [Turn Customer Input into
  Innovation](https://hbr.org/2002/01/turn-customer-input-into-innovation) –
  how to actually ask questions and discuss product questions with customers
  in order to get useful responses.
- [A Career Cold Start
  Algorithm](http://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start.html) – a simple way to
  learn from the experts when joining a new team, company or project.
- [Preparing for a Google product management
  interview](http://uk.businessinsider.com/google-email-product-manager-2017-3) –
  worth skimming to understand how Google hires for product management.
- [Google goes
  globe-trotting](https://www.newsweek.com/google-goes-globe-trotting-96341) –
  an old article but with such a famous product management training program,
  this is worth reading to understand how it all started. Interesting to see
  how many of the products mentioned have since been shut down!
- [This is why I never hire product
  managers](https://medium.com/the-mission/this-is-why-i-never-hire-product-managers-c321ca96505b) –
  an interesting take on why you don’t want people who have had past product
  management experience.
- [Good Product Manager / Bad Product
  Manager](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) –
  a great breakdown of how to think about what product management should be
  doing.
- [How to build an enduring, multi-billion dollar
  business](https://medium.com/@sarahtavel/how-to-build-an-enduring-multi-billion-dollar-business-hint-create-a-10x-product-recast-3527df2b8fcb) –
  create a 10x product + recast incumbent cost structures.
- [Why Amazon is eating the
  world](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/why-amazon-is-eating-the-world/) –
  I found this analysis of how Amazon has rebuilt its internal systems as
  individual products to be a useful way of thinking about feedback loops.
  Internal corporate tools tend to be significantly less polished than if they
  were to be used by external, paying customers…why? Surely you want your
  internal tools to be best in class? That can be a competitive differentiator
  in itself.
- [Why Software Development Requires Servant
  Leaders](https://adl.io/essays/why-software-development-requires-servant-leaders/#) –
  how to think about where the product manager and project manager roles fit
  into engineering management.
- [Practical Time
  Management](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/time-management-a38493d795cf)
- [Advice for a new
  executive](https://larahogan.me/blog/advice-for-new-executive/) – focused on
  CTO/VPE roles but still relevant to think about how to operate in a new
  executive role.
- [How to hire a product
  manager](https://www.kennethnorton.com/essays/productmanager.html) – also
  covers what the role actually is.
- I have also written a couple of posts related to product: [Easy to use and
  beautiful design are no longer
  differentiators](https://davidmytton.blog/easy-to-use-and-beautiful-design-are-no-longer-differentiators/), [How
  to prioritise what features to
  build](https://davidmytton.blog/how-to-prioritise-what-features-to-build/) and [Rewriting,
  refactoring, rearchitecting – when is the right
  time?](https://davidmytton.blog/rewriting-refactoring-rearchitecting-when-is-the-right-time/)

## Product management videos and talks

- [Customer
  Obsession](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/08/customer-obsession/) –
  from ProductTank San Francisco, this talk outlines: the balancing act of
  delighting customers in hard-to-copy margin-enhancing ways; how “customer
  obsession” helped Netflix to create a highly personalized experience; and
  the principles of customer obsession through a case study — “Should Netflix
  send a free trial reminder to its customers at the end of their four-week
  trial?”
- [Mastering the problem space for product/market
  fit](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2018/08/mastering-the-problem-space-for-product-market-fit-by-dan-olsen/) –
  this is a framework covering the universal conditions and patterns that have
  to hold true to achieve product/market fit. Each layer in the pyramid is a
  key hypothesis that you need to get right in order to build the next layer
  and ultimately achieve product/market fit.

## Good quotes on product management

Some select quotes from the linked content above that’s worth highlighting by
itself.

> In the 10+ years since AWS’s debut, Amazon has been systematically rebuilding
> each of its internal tools as an externally consumable service. A recent
> example is AWS’s Amazon Connect — a self-service, cloud-based contact center
> platform that is based on the same technology used in Amazon’s own call
> centers. Again, the “extra revenue” here is great — but the real value is in
> honing Amazon’s internal tools.
>
> If Amazon Connect is a complete commercial failure, Amazon’s management will
> have a quantifiable indicator (revenue, or lack thereof) that suggests their
> internal tools are significantly lagging behind the competition. Amazon has
> replaced useless, time-intensive bureaucracy like internal surveys and audits
> with a feedback loop that generates cash when it works — and quickly
> identifies problems when it doesn’t. They say that money earned is a
> reasonable approximation of the value you’re creating for the world, and
> Amazon has figured out a way to measure its own value in dozens of previously
> invisible areas.

> Perhaps most importantly, the product manager is the voice of the customer
> inside the business, and thus must be passionate about customers and the
> specific problems they’re trying to solve. This doesn’t mean the product
> manager should become a full-time researcher or a full-time designer, but they
> do need to make time for this important work. Getting out to talk to
> customers, testing the product, and getting feedback firsthand, as well as
> working closely with internal and external UX designers and researchers, are
> all part of this process.

Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148326-product-leadership)

> Many books emphasize the first two points—corporate strategy and culture
> setting. However, you will find that in practice you have little time in a
> high-growth, rapidly scaling company to think deeply about those points until
> you hire a strong executive team and manage your own time properly.

^ [High Growth
Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40536148-high-growth-handbook)

> There’s no point in defining what to build if you don’t know how it will get
> built. This doesn’t mean a product manager needs to be able to code, but
> understanding the technology stack — and most importantly, the level of effort
> involved — is crucial to making the right decisions.

^ [Product
Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148326-product-leadership)

> Another lesson that I learned from Brian Chesky—one way to think about when to
> upgrade executives—is that a really great executive is about six to twelve
> months ahead of the curve. They’re already planning for and acting on things
> that are going to be important six to twelve months in the future. A decent
> executive is delivering in real time, now to one to three months in advance.

> The trick to creating a great product team is to think of them as the product.
> This is not an objectification but rather a thought exercise. After all, they
> are the product that creates the product. Without them, there is no product.
> Amazing teams make amazing products. Seen from this perspective, the task of
> how to hire, onboard, train, and develop them becomes another product design
> problem. The approach that successful leaders take to creating great product
> is the same approach they take to creating great product teams.

Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148326-product-leadership)

> Often the hardest part of the communication is communicating the “why” behind
> the product road map, prioritization, and sequencing. Part of this will be
> creating a framework that establishes why some things are prioritized higher
> than others—and it’s important that all other functions buy into this
> framework.

> Out of the goals will come the specific features for development. Like a
> ripple effect with the vision at the center, the objectives or goals are
> generated and they in turn generate the features that support those goals.
> Never start with features. Even if your business or product is based on a
> “feature concept,” ask yourself what the bigger problem is and why it needs
> solving. Any feature shouldn’t be considered, prioritized, or delivered in a
> vacuum. Without a vision to guide the product creation, a project can quickly
> become a collection of cool solutions lacking a core problem to guide them.
> Features need to be directly tied to the product or organization’s strategic
> goals.

> For example, if you as the designer/manager discover that you as the worker
> can’t do something well, you need to fire yourself as the worker and get a

> If you are not evolving your organizational design, it might be an indicator

> As GV’s Ken Norton says, “I like to start with the problem. Smart people are

> going to build, I must understand the problem at a deep level. Then success is
> easy to articulate, because you know what it’s like when that problem is
