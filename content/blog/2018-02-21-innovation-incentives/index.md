Understanding the business stage is important when trying to decide the best way
to incentivise your team. Startups exist in a state of uncertainty, rapidly
iterating to find product/market fit which can scale up. This is quite different
from a large corporate with revenues that are likely to be sustainable for the
long term.

Incentive schemes must be stage appropriate. They have to reward reaching key
milestones which allow the business to transition to the next stage. So what
does this actually mean for a startup? How should incentives be designed for
those initial 12-18 months of the life of a startup?

## Salary

At its most basic, an incentive is a trade. You're trading an object of value
for something else of value. For employees, this starts with money being
exchanged for time. The value of that time is determined by a number of factors
particular to the individual - their experience and their skills - in relation
to the availability of someone similar within the market. Of course it's not
quite as simple a calculation as that, but this a basic approach to thinking
about salary.

But salary is just the starting point. There are many other aspects of an
employment package which make up compensation, which is in turn just one part of
what incentivises people to work.

This is important because incentives have to be more granular than just a
salary. The salary is really there just to trade money for time in the pursuit
of a goal, but it doesn't change whether that goal is achieved or not. Indeed,
it's not supposed to - a good proportion of someone's salary is for subsistence.
It's what they need to live. Rent/mortgage. Food. Travel. Clothes.

The only thing that salary is linked to is the survival of the business. If it
fails, you're out of a job. Certain roles tie success not to the entire business
but hitting quotas or targets, such as in sales. Those who are not very good at
the job quickly move on. But for most role, there's not such a direct
association between quantitative success and whether you get fired or not.

By itself, salary is therefore an insufficient incentive for most startups.

## Bonuses and commission

Bonuses and commission are the next thing which come to mind as very common
options for incentives.

Commission is quite easy to deal with because it is just like linking
salary/being fired to quotas. Commission is appropriate for sales based roles,
[whether new business or account
management](https://davidmytton.blog/what-is-the-difference-between-customer-success-and-account-management/).
It directly incentivises increasing the revenue of the business, which is the
main goal for most for-profit organisations. However, it is very specific to
sales roles and so isn't helpful when considering a broader incentive scheme.

Bonuses are more challenging. The criteria which determines when a bonus is paid
needs careful consideration. The goal must be clear and quantitative. It has to
be achievable, but not too easily. And achieving the goal should provide more
value to the business than the monetary value of the bonus (at least over the
long term). Some consideration should also be paid to exceeding the goal - is it
a binary state of achieved vs not, or is there a scale of achievement? In a pure
sense, once the goal is achieved and bonus paid, there is no incentive to go any
further even though this may be beneficial for the business. So can the bonus
amount increase based on what is achieved? How high should it go?

Bonuses also have organisation-wide context. Who gets a bonus and how does it
relate to the bonus structure for the rest of the team? People will compare
their bonuses both in terms of the value and what they have to do to hit it.
It's very difficult to equalise all bonuses so there may be a negative incentive
because someone is unhappy that their bonus is smaller or harder to hit.

## Organisation wide goals

Salary, bonuses and commission are all paid to individuals on individual
success. How do we incentivise a team or the whole organisation?

Well, bonuses apply here too. Everyone should be working towards a single goal
for the organisation and if the effort of the group means you hit it, the group
can benefit.

All the problems of bonuses apply here though so for more mature businesses, a
profit sharing scheme is a good alternative. It is not a fixed amount so aligns
both the goals of achieving a profit, and growing it. With proper transparency
into the spending patterns (and decisions), the team can be involved with
commercial decisions about whether to increase spending and how to cut costs.

Startups usually use stock options as another form of incentive. However, these
only have value if a) the business is acquired (for more than the strike price);
or b) the business goes public. Both outcomes are extremely rare and so far into
the future that for all incentive based discussions, their value is basically
zero. There is of course some value to feeling like you own part of the business
and you will benefit in those two events to which you have contributed, but that
value is not quantifiable in advance.

That's not to say stock options shouldn't be a standard part of startup
incentive plans, but for the purpose of this discussion their uncertainty means
they're not a particularly useful incentive.

## More individual choice

The problem with organisation wide incentives like profit share, bonuses and
stock options is that they reward everyone regardless of effort. There should be
consideration for the differences between someone who is putting in 30 hours a
week vs someone putting in 60.

There is a growing movement focused around work/life balance, with [schemes like
30 hour weeks](https://www.ft.com/content/78c5cebe-111b-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277)
and ensuring staff get proper breaks by [deleting all their email when they are
holiday](https://www.ft.com/content/abe36902-22d9-11e4-8dae-00144feabdc0).

Whether this new way of working is reconcilable with the level of dedication
needed in the early days of a startup is something I'd like to write about
further. Is the legendary worth ethic of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk necessary for
billion dollar outcomes? But for the purposes of incentives, there has to be a
link between effort and reward. Effort does not necessarily = results. Working
more hours doesn't mean better outcomes. [According to some recent
research](https://www.ft.com/content/6c87ad84-11bb-11e8-a765-993b2440bd73):

> ...people who sleep fewer than six hours a night are 2.4 per cent less
> productive than those who get between seven and nine hours. Overall, the UK
> loses hundreds of thousands of working days due to insufficient sleep, costing
> the economy £40bn each year, or almost 2 per cent of gross domestic product.

At some point, the incentives to work more generate negative outcomes. As such,
the level of productivity and output must also be part of the calculation.

Why not let people choose?

If your goal is something other than more money - family time, hobbies,
travelling, reading - why not opt to work less in return for a different
compensation package?

Of course, another word for this is "part time" but that typically implies a
proportional salary reduction which might not viable for people who need their
entire salary to live. How about if you could trade fewer working hours with
your bonus, or a lower commission? Indeed, this might even incentivise you to be
significantly more productive to achieve the same (or more) in less time.

[Amazon is piloting something
similar](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/26/amazon-is-piloting-teams-with-a-30-hour-work-week/)
with an experiment allowing technical teams that work 30-hour weeks for the same
benefits and three-quarters the pay of 40-hour employees.

## Innovation in incentives

It seems to me that just being paid a salary is quite an inefficient way of
incentivising your team.

For the business, it is a fixed overhead that has no real power to incentivise
achieving company goals (neither once nor as they evolve).

For the employee, it just serves to fulfil basic security needs and has no
relationship between effort or achievement. It's a backwards looking measure of
your worth in the market at the time you were hired and does nothing to link you
to the success of the organisation you're spending so much time with.

With more and more focus on work / life balance, there has to be more innovation
in incentives. Bonuses and profit sharing might not sound innovative, but it's
interesting to consider how they're applied to help encourage achieving goals
for the individual and the organisation.

I think we'll start to see more choice for employees joining new, innovative
businesses that help align them much more in the short term, the long term, with
financial outcomes and overall wellbeing. Compensation packages should be just
that - a package selected from various options that are truly linked to outcomes
and motivations. This will provide a compelling differentiator in the labour
market and make success more likely overall.
