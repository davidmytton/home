summary: "Book recommendations and reading log."
---

I have been keeping a log of every book I read, plus a rating, since the end of 2017. This was originally on Goodreads, but I wanted to own the data rather than
giving it to Amazon. [I still think the Kindle is great](/uses/), but I want to
control the publication of my reading history.

I update this page periodically and [I write an annual blog
post](/favourite-books/) listing my favourite books of that year. I also have a
post with [book recommendations for startup
founders](/the-best-books-for-startup-founders-and-ceos/).

Books below are sorted in the order I read them, most recent first. My rating
system is as follows:

- **Good:** Recommended reading.
- **Ok:** Not a bad book, but not recommended. There’s too little time and too
  many books, so you might as well focus on the best ones.
- **Bad:** Do not read.
